AB  - Communicable diseases are often virulent, i.e. they cause morbidity
      symptoms in those infected. While some symptoms may be transmission-
      enhancing, other symptoms are likely to reduce transmission potential.
      For human diseases, the reduction in transmission opportunities is
      commonly caused by reduced activity. There is limited data regarding the
      potential impact of virulence on transmission potential. We performed an
      exploratory data analysis of 324 influenza patients at a university
      health centre during the 2016/2017 influenza season. We classified
      symptoms as infectiousness-related or morbidity-related and calculated
      two scores. The scores were used to explore the relationship between
      infectiousness, morbidity (virulence), and activity level. We found a
      decrease in the activity level with increasing morbidity scores. There
      was no consistent pattern between an activity level and an infectiousness
      score. We also found a positive correlation between morbidity and
      infectiousness scores. Overall, we find that increasing virulence leads
      to increased infectiousness and reduced activity, suggesting a trade-off
      that can impact overall transmission potential. Our findings indicate
      that a reduction of systemic symptoms may increase host activity without
      reducing infectiousness. Therefore, interventions should target both
      systemic- and infectiousness-related symptoms to reduce overall
      transmission potential. Our findings can also inform simulation models
      that investigate the impact of different interventions on transmission.

TI  - Varying Inoculum Dose to Assess the Roles of the Immune Response and
      Target Cell Depletion by the Pathogen in Control of Acute Viral
      Infections.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1007/s11538-020-00711-4 [doi]
AB  - It is difficult to determine whether an immune response or target cell
      depletion by the infectious agent is most responsible for the control of
      acute primary infection. Both mechanisms can explain the basic dynamics
      of an acute infection-exponential growth of the pathogen followed by
      control and clearance-and can also be represented by many different
      differential equation models. Consequently, traditional model comparison
      techniques using time series data can be ambiguous or inconclusive. We
      propose that varying the inoculum dose and measuring the subsequent
      infectious load can rule out target cell depletion by the pathogen as the
      main control mechanism. Infectious load can be any measure that is
      proportional to the number of infected cells, such as viraemia. We show
      that a twofold or greater change in infectious load is unlikely when
      target cell depletion controls infection, regardless of the model
      details. Analyzing previously published data from mice infected with
      influenza, we find the proportion of lung epithelial cells infected was
      21-fold greater (95% confidence interval 14-32) in the highest dose group
      than in the lowest. This provides evidence in favor of an alternative to
      target cell depletion, such as innate immunity, in controlling influenza
      infections in this experimental system. Data from other experimental
      animal models of acute primary infection have a similar pattern.

AB  - The immune system is inordinately complex with many interacting
      components determining overall outcomes. Mathematical and computational
      modelling provides a useful way in which the various contributions of
      different immunological components can be probed in an integrated manner.
      Here, we provide an introductory overview and review of mechanistic
      simulation models. We start out by briefly defining these types of models
      and contrasting them to other model types that are relevant to the field
      of immunology. We follow with a few specific examples and then review the
      different ways one can use such models to answer immunological questions.
      While our examples focus on immune responses to infection, the overall
      ideas and descriptions of model uses can be applied to any area of
      immunology.

TI  - A Risk Classification Model to Predict Mortality Among Laboratory-
      Confirmed Avian Influenza A H7N9 Patients: A Population-Based
      Observational Cohort Study.
PG  - 1780-1789
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiz328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Avian influenza A H7N9 (A/H7N9) is characterized by rapid
      progressive pneumonia and respiratory failure. Mortality among
      laboratory-confirmed cases is above 30%; however, the clinical course of
      disease is variable and patients at high risk for death are not well
      characterized. METHODS: We obtained demographic, clinical, and laboratory
      information on all A/H7N9 patients in Zhejiang province from China
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention electronic databases. Risk
      factors for death were identified using logistic regression and a risk
      score was created using regression coefficients from multivariable
      models. We externally validated this score in an independent cohort from
      Jiangsu province. RESULTS: Among 305 A/H7N9 patients, 115 (37.7%) died.
      Four independent predictors of death were identified: older age,
      diabetes, bilateral lung infection, and neutrophil percentage. We
      constructed a score with 0-13 points. Mortality rates in low- (0-3),
      medium- (4-6), and high-risk (7-13) groups were 4.6%, 32.1%, and 62.7%
      (Ptrend < .0001). In a validation cohort of 111 A/H7N9 patients, 61 (55%)
      died. Mortality rates in low-, medium-, and high-risk groups were 35.5%,
      55.8, and 67.4% (Ptrend = .0063). CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated
      a simple-to-use, predictive risk score for clinical use, identifying
      patients at high mortality risk.

PG  - 2846
LID - 10.1038/s41467-019-10661-8 [doi]
AB  - The magnitude of T cell responses to infection is a function of the naive
      T cell repertoire combined with the context and duration of antigen
      presentation. Using mass spectrometry, we identify and quantify 21 class
      1 MHC-restricted influenza A virus (IAV)-peptides following either direct
      or cross-presentation. All these peptides, including seven novel
      epitopes, elicit T cell responses in infected C57BL/6 mice. Directly
      presented IAV epitopes maintain their relative abundance across distinct
      cell types and reveal a broad range of epitope abundances. In contrast,
      cross-presented epitopes are more uniform in abundance. We observe a
      clear disparity in the abundance of the two key immunodominant IAV
      antigens, wherein direct infection drives optimal nucleoprotein
      (NP)366-374 presentation, while cross-presentation is optimal for acid
      polymerase (PA)224-233 presentation. The study demonstrates how
      assessment of epitope abundance in both modes of antigen presentation is
      necessary to fully understand the immunogenicity and response magnitude
      to T cell epitopes.

AB  - Directly observed therapy (DOT) is almost universally used for the
      treatment of TB. Several meta-analyses using different methods have
      assessed the effectiveness of DOT compared to self-administered therapy
      (SAT). The results of these meta-analyses often conflict with some
      concluding DOT is superior and others that there is little or no
      difference. Meta-analyses can guide policymaking, but such analyses must
      be reliable. To assess the validity of a previous meta-analysis, we tried
      to reproduce it. We encountered problems with the previous analysis that
      did not allow for a meaningful reproduction. We describe the issues we
      encountered here. We then performed a new meta-analysis comparing the
      treatment outcomes of adults given treatment with SAT versus DOT.
      Outcomes in the new analysis are loss to follow-up, treatment failure,
      cure, treatment completed, and all-cause mortality. All data,
      documentation, and code used to generate our results is provided. Our new
      analysis included four randomized and three observational studies with
      1603 and 1626 individuals respectively. The pooled relative risks (RR)
      are as follows: Lost to follow-up (RR = 1.2, 95% CI 0.9, 1.7), Treatment
      Failure (RR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.6, 2), Cure (RR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.8, 1.1),
      Treatment Completion (RR = 1, 95% CI 0.9, 1.1), Mortality (RR = 0.9, 95%
      CI 0.6, 1.3). Based on data from our new meta-analysis, the magnitude of
      the difference between DOT and SAT for all reported outcomes is small,
      and none of the differences are statistically significant.

      Consistent Care and Antibiotic Use.

LID - 10.3122/jabfm.2019.02.180183 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid influenza diagnostic tests that detect the presence of
      viral antigens are currently used throughout the United States but have
      poor sensitivity. The objective of this study was to identify if the use
      of a new highly accurate rapid point of care test would significantly
      increase the likelihood of guideline consistent care. METHODS: We
      prospectively recruited 300 students at a university health clinic who
      presented with cough and 1 influenza-like illness symptom between
      December 2016 and February 2017 to receive care guided by a rapid
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Of the 300 patients receiving the
      PCR test, 264 had complete medical records and were compared to 771 who
      received usual care. We used a logistic regression model to identify
      whether PCR guided care was associated with guideline consistent care,
      based on the appropriate use of oseltamivir and antibiotics. We also
      assessed whether PCR guided care decreased the likelihood of return
      visits within 2 weeks by patients. RESULTS: Logistic regression revealed
      that the odds of receiving guideline supported care did not significantly
      increase for patients who received PCR guided care (adjusted odds ratio
      [aOR], 1.24; 95% CI, 0.83-1.88). It significantly decreased the
      likelihood of an antibiotic prescription (aOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.94),
      increased the likelihood of receiving oseltamivir (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI,
      1.09-2.28), and decreased the likelihood of return visit within 2 weeks
      (aOR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.81). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a rapid PCR test
      did not significantly improve the likelihood of guideline consistent
      care. However, independent of test outcome, patients who received the
      test were more likely to receive an antiviral and less likely to receive
      an antibiotic or have a return visit within 2 weeks.

PG  - 203-216

AB  - The use of parametric linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed
      models to analyze longitudinal data collected during randomized control
      trials (RCT) is conventional. The application of these methods, however,
      is restricted due to various assumptions required by these models. When
      the number of observations per subject is sufficiently large, and
      individual trajectories are noisy, functional data analysis (FDA) methods
      serve as an alternative to parametric longitudinal data analysis
      techniques. However, the use of FDA in randomized control trials, is
      rare. In this paper, the effectiveness of FDA and linear mixed models was
      compared by analyzing data from rural persons living with HIV and
      comorbid depression enrolled in a depression treatment randomized
      clinical trial. Interactive voice response (IVR) systems were used for
      weekly administrations of the 10-item Self-Administered Depression Scale
      (SADS) over 41 weeks. Functional principal component analysis and
      functional regression analysis methods detected a statistically
      significant difference in SADS between telphone-administered
      interpersonal psychotherapy (tele-IPT) and controls but, linear mixed
      effects model results did not. Additional simulation studies were
      conducted to compare FDA and linear mixed models under a different
      nonlinear trajectory assumption. In this clinical trial with sufficient
      per subject measured outcomes and individual trajectories that are noisy
      and nonlinear, we found functional data analysis methods to be a better
      alternative to linear mixed models.

TI  - Exploring the impact of inoculum dose on host immunity and morbidity to
      inform model-based vaccine design.
PG  - e1006505
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006505 [doi]
AB  - Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious
      diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the
      inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that
      is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune
      response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less
      population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the
      optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational
      vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental
      data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate
      the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose
      determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from
      influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus
      (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the
      model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and
      morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine
      an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines
      mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the
      impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection
      and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose
      on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen
      and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase
      monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals
      are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of
      morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of
      vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate diagnostic agreement of the QuantiFERON(R)-TB
      Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) test in adult tuberculin skin test (TST)
      converters in a high tuberculosis (TB) burden setting. SETTING AND
      DESIGN: We performed a case-cohort study from 2014 to 2016 in Uganda
      among residents who were not infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
      Participants were followed up for 1 year, when they were retested to
      determine TST conversion. All TST converters and a random sample of
      participants from baseline were offered QFT-GIT testing. RESULTS: Of 368
      enrolled participants, 61 (17%) converted their TST by 1 year. Among 61
      converters, 42 were tested using QFT-GIT, 64% of whom were QFT-GIT-
      positive. Of 307 participants with a persistent negative TST, 48 were
      tested using QFT-GIT, 83% of whom were QFT-negative. Overall concordance
      of TST and QFT-GIT was moderate (kappa = 0.48, 95%CI 0.30-0.66).
      Converters with a conversion of 15 mm had a higher proportion of
      concordant QFT-GIT results (79%) than converters with increments of
      10-14.9 mm (52%). CONCLUSION: Concordance between TST and QFT-GIT was
      moderate among TST converters in this urban African population. These
      findings call for improved tests that more accurately measure conversion
      to tuberculous infection.

TI  - Heterogeneity and longevity of antibody memory to viruses and vaccines.

AB  - Determining the duration of protective immunity requires quantifying the
      magnitude and rate of loss of antibodies to different virus and vaccine
      antigens. A key complication is heterogeneity in both the magnitude and
      decay rate of responses of different individuals to a given vaccine, as
      well as of a given individual to different vaccines. We analyzed
      longitudinal data on antibody titers in 45 individuals to characterize
      the extent of this heterogeneity and used models to determine how it
      affected the longevity of protective immunity to measles, rubella,
      vaccinia, tetanus, and diphtheria. Our analysis showed that the magnitude
      of responses in different individuals varied between 12- and 200-fold
      (95% coverage) depending on the antigen. Heterogeneity in the magnitude
      and decay rate contribute comparably to variation in the longevity of
      protective immunity between different individuals. We found that some
      individuals have, on average, slightly longer-lasting memory than others-
      on average, they have higher antibody levels with slower decay rates. We
      identified different patterns for the loss of protective levels of
      antibodies to different vaccine and virus antigens. Specifically, we
      found that for the first 25 to 50 years, virtually all individuals have
      protective antibody titers against diphtheria and tetanus, respectively,
      but about 10% of the population subsequently lose protective immunity per
      decade. In contrast, at the outset, not all individuals had protective
      titers against measles, rubella, and vaccinia. However, these antibody
      titers wane much more slowly, with a loss of protective immunity in only
      1% to 3% of the population per decade. Our results highlight the
      importance of long-term longitudinal studies for estimating the duration
      of protective immunity and suggest both how vaccines might be improved
      and how boosting schedules might be reevaluated.

TI  - Intermediate levels of vaccination coverage may minimize seasonal
      influenza outbreaks.
PG  - e0199674
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0199674 [doi]
AB  - For most pathogens, vaccination reduces the spread of the infection and
      total number of cases; thus, public policy usually advocates maximizing
      vaccination coverage. We use simple mathematical models to explore how
      this may be different for pathogens, such as influenza, which exhibit
      strain variation. Our models predict that the total number of seasonal
      influenza infections is minimized at an intermediate (rather than
      maximal) level of vaccination, and, somewhat counter-intuitively, further
      increasing the level of the vaccination coverage may lead to higher
      number of influenza infections and be detrimental to the public interest.
      This arises due to the combined effects of: competition between multiple
      co-circulating strains; limited breadth of protection afforded by the
      vaccine; and short-term strain-transcending immunity following natural
      infection. The study highlights the need for better quantification of the
      components of vaccine efficacy and longevity of strain-transcending
      cross-immunity in order to generate nuanced recommendations for influenza
      vaccine coverage levels.

TI  - Effectiveness of WHO's pragmatic screening algorithm for child contacts
      of tuberculosis cases in resource-constrained settings: a prospective
      cohort study in Uganda.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is a leading cause of global childhood
      mortality; however, interventions to detect undiagnosed tuberculosis in
      children are underused. Child contact tracing has been widely recommended
      but poorly implemented in resource-constrained settings. WHO has proposed
      a pragmatic screening approach for managing child contacts. We assessed
      the effectiveness of this screening approach and alternative symptom-
      based algorithms in identifying secondary tuberculosis in a prospectively
      followed cohort of Ugandan child contacts. METHODS: We identified index
      patients aged at least 18 years with microbiologically confirmed
      pulmonary tuberculosis at Old Mulago Hospital (Kampala, Uganda) between
      Oct 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2008. Households of index patients were visited
      by fieldworkers within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Coprevalent and incident
      tuberculosis were assessed in household contacts through clinical,
      radiographical, and microbiological examinations for 2 years. Disease
      rates were compared among children younger than 16 years with and without
      symptoms included in the WHO pragmatic guideline (presence of
      haemoptysis, fever, chronic cough, weight loss, night sweats, and poor
      appetite). Symptoms could be of any duration, except cough (>21 days) and
      fever (>14 days). A modified WHO decision-tree designed to detect high-
      risk asymptomatic child contacts was also assessed, in which all
      asymptomatic contacts were classified as high risk (children younger than
      3 years or immunocompromised [HIV-infected]) or low risk (aged 3 years or
      older and immunocompetent [HIV-negative]). We also assessed a more
      restrictive algorithm (ie, assessing only children with presence of
      chronic cough and one other tuberculosis-related symptom). FINDINGS: Of
      1718 household child contacts, 126 (7%) had coprevalent tuberculosis and
      24 (1%) developed incident tuberculosis, diagnosed over the 2-year study
      period. Of these 150 cases of tuberculosis, 95 (63%) were
      microbiologically confirmed with a positive sputum culture. Using the WHO
      approach, 364 (21%) of 1718 child contacts had at least one tuberculosis-
      related symptom and 85 (23%) were identified as having coprevalent
      tuberculosis, 67% of all coprevalent cases detected (diagnostic odds
      ratio 9.8, 95% CI 6.8-14.5; p<0.0001). 1354 (79%) of 1718 child contacts
      had no symptoms, of whom 41 (3%) had coprevalent tuberculosis. The WHO
      approach was effective in contacts younger than 5 years: 70 (33%) of 211
      symptomatic contacts had coprevalent disease compared with 23 (6%) of 367
      asymptomatic contacts (p<0.0001). This approach was also effective in
      contacts aged 5 years and older: 15 (10%) of 153 symptomatic contacts had
      coprevalent disease compared with 18 (2%) of 987 asymptomatic contacts
      (p<0.0001). More coprevalent disease was detected in child contacts
      recommended for screening when the study population was restricted by
      HIV-serostatus (11 [48%] of 23 symptomatic HIV-seropositive child
      contacts vs two [7%] of 31 asymptomatic HIV-seropositive child contacts)
      or to only culture-confirmed cases (47 [13%] culture confirmed cases of
      364 symptomatic child contacts vs 29 [2%] culture confirmed cases of 1354
      asymptomatic child contacts). In the modified algorithm, high-risk
      asymptomatic child contacts were at increased risk for coprevalent
      disease versus low-risk asymptomatic contacts (14 [6%] of 224 vs 27 [2%]
      of 1130; p=0.0021). The presence of tuberculosis infection did not
      predict incident disease in either symptomatic or asymptomatic child
      contacts: in symptomatic contacts, eight (5%) of 169 infected contacts
      and six (5%) of 111 uninfected contacts developed incident tuberculosis
      (p=0.80). Among asymptomatic contacts, incident tuberculosis occurred in
      six (<1%) of 795 contacts infected at baseline versus four (<1%) of 518
      contacts uninfected at baseline, respectively (p=1.00). INTERPRETATION:
      WHO's pragmatic, symptom-based algorithm was an effective case-finding
      tool, especially in children younger than 5 years. A modified decision-
      tree identified 6% of asymptomatic child contacts at high risk for
      subclinical disease. Increasing the feasibility of child-contact tracing
      using these approaches should be encouraged to decrease tuberculosis-
      related paediatric mortality in high-burden settings, but this should be
      partnered with increasing access to microbiological point-of-care
      testing. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health, Tuberculosis Research

TI  - Dominant protection from HLA-linked autoimmunity by antigen-specific
      regulatory T cells.
PG  - 243-247
LID - 10.1038/nature22329 [doi]
AB  - Susceptibility and protection against human autoimmune diseases,
      including type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and Goodpasture disease,
      is associated with particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles.
      However, the mechanisms underpinning such HLA-mediated effects on self-
      tolerance remain unclear. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism of
      Goodpasture disease, an HLA-linked autoimmune renal disorder
      characterized by an immunodominant CD4(+) T-cell self-epitope derived
      from the alpha3 chain of type IV collagen (alpha3135-145). While HLA-DR15
      confers a markedly increased disease risk, the protective HLA-DR1 allele
      is dominantly protective in trans with HLA-DR15 (ref. 2). We show that
      autoreactive alpha3135-145-specific T cells expand in patients with
      Goodpasture disease and, in alpha3135-145-immunized HLA-DR15 transgenic
      mice, alpha3135-145-specific T cells infiltrate the kidney and mice
      develop Goodpasture disease. HLA-DR15 and HLA-DR1 exhibit distinct
      peptide repertoires and binding preferences and present the alpha3135-145
      epitope in different binding registers. HLA-DR15-alpha3135-145
      tetramer(+) T cells in HLA-DR15 transgenic mice exhibit a conventional
      T-cell phenotype (Tconv) that secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines. In
      contrast, HLA-DR1-alpha3135-145 tetramer(+) T cells in HLA-DR1 and HLA-
      DR15/DR1 transgenic mice are predominantly CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T
      cells (Treg cells) expressing tolerogenic cytokines. HLA-DR1-induced Treg
      cells confer resistance to disease in HLA-DR15/DR1 transgenic mice. HLA-
      DR15(+) and HLA-DR1(+) healthy human donors display altered
      alpha3135-145-specific T-cell antigen receptor usage, HLA-
      DR15-alpha3135-145 tetramer(+) Foxp3(-) Tconv and HLA-DR1-alpha3135-145
      tetramer(+) Foxp3(+)CD25(hi)CD127(lo) Treg dominant phenotypes. Moreover,
      patients with Goodpasture disease display a clonally expanded
      alpha3135-145-specific CD4(+) T-cell repertoire. Accordingly, we provide
      a mechanistic basis for the dominantly protective effect of HLA in
      autoimmune disease, whereby HLA polymorphism shapes the relative
      abundance of self-epitope specific Treg cells that leads to protection or
      causation of autoimmunity.

TI  - Is IPT more effective in high-burden settings? Modelling the effect of
      tuberculosis incidence on IPT impact.
PG  - 60-66
LID - 10.5588/ijtld.16.0297 [doi]
AB  - SETTING: Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is effective for preventing
      active tuberculosis (TB), although its mechanism of action is poorly
      understood and the optimal disease burden for IPT use has not been
      defined. OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between TB incidence and
      IPT effectiveness. METHODS: We constructed a model of TB transmission
      dynamics to investigate IPT effectiveness under various epidemiological
      settings. The model structure was intended to be highly adaptable to
      uncertainty in both input parameters and the mechanism of action of IPT.
      To determine the optimal setting for IPT use, we identified the lowest
      number needed to treat (NNT) with IPT to prevent one case of active TB.
      RESULTS: We found that the NNT as a function of TB incidence shows a
      'U-shape', whereby IPT impact is greatest at an intermediate incidence
      and attenuated at both lower and higher incidence levels. This U-shape
      was observed over a broad range of parameter values; the optimal TB
      incidence was between 500 and 900 cases per 100 000 per year.
      CONCLUSIONS: TB burden is a critical factor to consider when making
      decisions about communitywide implementation of IPT. We believe that the
      total disease burden should not preclude programmatic application of IPT.

TI  - Targeting pediatric versus elderly populations for norovirus vaccines: a
      model-based analysis of mass vaccination options.

LID - S1755-4365(16)30038-X [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis
      and foodborne diarrheal disease in the United States. Norovirus vaccine
      development has progressed in recent years, but critical questions remain
      regarding which age groups should be vaccinated to maximize population
      impact. METHODS: We developed a deterministic, age-structured
      compartmental model of norovirus transmission and immunity in the U.S.
      POPULATION: The model was fit to age-specific monthly U.S.
      hospitalizations between 1996 and 2007. We simulated mass immunization of
      both pediatric and elderly populations assuming realistic coverages of
      90% and 65%, respectively. We considered two mechanism of vaccine action,
      resulting in lower vaccine efficacy (lVE) between 22% and 43% and higher
      VE (hVE) of 50%. RESULTS: Pediatric vaccination was predicted to avert
      33% (95% CI: 27%, 40%) and 60% (95% CI: 49%, 71%) of norovirus episodes
      among children under five years for lVE and hVE, respectively.
      Vaccinating the elderly averted 17% (95% CI: 12%, 20%) and 38% (95% CI:
      34%, 42%) of cases in 65+ year olds for lVE and hVE, respectively. At a
      population level, pediatric vaccination was predicted to avert 18-21
      times more cases and twice as many deaths per vaccinee compared to
      elderly vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The potential benefits are likely
      greater for a pediatric program, both via direct protection of vaccinated
      children and indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals, including
      adults and the elderly. These findings argue for a clinical development
      plan that will deliver a vaccine with a safety and efficacy profile
      suitable for use in children.

TI  - Viral factors in influenza pandemic risk assessment.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.18491 [doi]
LID - e18491 [pii]
AB  - The threat of an influenza A virus pandemic stems from continual virus
      spillovers from reservoir species, a tiny fraction of which spark
      sustained transmission in humans. To date, no pandemic emergence of a new
      influenza strain has been preceded by detection of a closely related
      precursor in an animal or human. Nonetheless, influenza surveillance
      efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the pandemic
      risk posed by a detected virus. The goal would be to use genetic sequence
      and/or biological assays of viral traits to identify those non-human
      influenza viruses with the greatest risk of evolving into pandemic
      threats, and/or to understand drivers of such evolution, to prioritize
      pandemic prevention or response measures. We describe such efforts,
      identify progress and ongoing challenges, and discuss three specific
      traits of influenza viruses (hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity,
      hemagglutinin pH of activation, and polymerase complex efficiency) that
      contribute to pandemic risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The post-2015 End TB Strategy proposes targets of 50%
      reduction in tuberculosis incidence and 75% reduction in mortality from
      tuberculosis by 2025. We aimed to assess whether these targets are
      feasible in three high-burden countries with contrasting epidemiology and
      previous programmatic achievements. METHODS: 11 independently developed
      mathematical models of tuberculosis transmission projected the
      epidemiological impact of currently available tuberculosis interventions
      for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in China, India, and South
      Africa. Models were calibrated with data on tuberculosis incidence and
      mortality in 2012. Representatives from national tuberculosis programmes
      and the advocacy community provided distinct country-specific
      intervention scenarios, which included screening for symptoms, active
      case finding, and preventive therapy. FINDINGS: Aggressive scale-up of
      any single intervention scenario could not achieve the post-2015 End TB
      Strategy targets in any country. However, the models projected that, in
      the South Africa national tuberculosis programme scenario, a combination
      of continuous isoniazid preventive therapy for individuals on
      antiretroviral therapy, expanded facility-based screening for symptoms of
      tuberculosis at health centres, and improved tuberculosis care could
      achieve a 55% reduction in incidence (range 31-62%) and a 72% reduction
      in mortality (range 64-82%) compared with 2015 levels. For India, and
      particularly for China, full scale-up of all interventions in
      tuberculosis-programme performance fell short of the 2025 targets,
      despite preventing a cumulative 3.4 million cases. The advocacy scenarios
      illustrated the high impact of detecting and treating latent
      tuberculosis. INTERPRETATION: Major reductions in tuberculosis burden
      seem possible with current interventions. However, additional
      interventions, adapted to country-specific tuberculosis epidemiology and
      health systems, are needed to reach the post-2015 End TB Strategy targets
      at country level. FUNDING: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

      tuberculosis in China, India, and South Africa: a combined analysis of

AB  - BACKGROUND: The post-2015 End TB Strategy sets global targets of reducing
      tuberculosis incidence by 50% and mortality by 75% by 2025. We aimed to
      assess resource requirements and cost-effectiveness of strategies to
      achieve these targets in China, India, and South Africa. METHODS: We
      examined intervention scenarios developed in consultation with country
      stakeholders, which scaled up existing interventions to high but feasible
      coverage by 2025. Nine independent modelling groups collaborated to
      estimate policy outcomes, and we estimated the cost of each scenario by
      synthesising service use estimates, empirical cost data, and expert
      opinion on implementation strategies. We estimated health effects (ie,
      disability-adjusted life-years averted) and resource implications for
      2016-35, including patient-incurred costs. To assess resource
      requirements and cost-effectiveness, we compared scenarios with a base
      case representing continued current practice. FINDINGS: Incremental
      tuberculosis service costs differed by scenario and country, and in some
      cases they more than doubled existing funding needs. In general,
      expansion of tuberculosis services substantially reduced patient-incurred
      costs and, in India and China, produced net cost savings for most
      interventions under a societal perspective. In all three countries,
      expansion of access to care produced substantial health gains. Compared
      with current practice and conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds,
      most intervention approaches seemed highly cost-effective.
      INTERPRETATION: Expansion of tuberculosis services seems cost-effective
      for high-burden countries and could generate substantial health and
      economic benefits for patients, although substantial new funding would be
      required. Further work to determine the optimal intervention mix for each
      country is necessary. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

TI  - Mathematical Model Reveals the Role of Memory CD8 T Cell Populations in
      Recall Responses to Influenza.
PG  - 165
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2016.00165 [doi]
AB  - The current influenza vaccine provides narrow protection against the
      strains included in the vaccine, and needs to be reformulated every few
      years in response to the constantly evolving new strains. Novel
      approaches are directed toward developing vaccines that provide broader
      protection by targeting B and T cell epitopes that are conserved between
      different strains of the virus. In this paper, we focus on developing
      mathematical models to explore the CD8 T cell responses to influenza, how
      they can be boosted, and the conditions under which they contribute to
      protection. Our models suggest that the interplay between spatial
      heterogeneity (with the virus infecting the respiratory tract and the
      immune response being generated in the secondary lymphoid organs) and T
      cell differentiation (with proliferation occurring in the lymphoid organs
      giving rise to a subpopulation of resident T cells in the respiratory
      tract) is the key to understand the dynamics of protection afforded by
      the CD8 T cell response to influenza. Our results suggest that the time
      lag for the generation of resident T cells in the respiratory tract and
      their rate of decay following infection are the key factors that limit
      the efficacy of CD8 T cell responses. The models predict that an increase
      in the level of central memory T cells leads to a gradual decrease in the
      viral load, and, in contrast, there is a sharper protection threshold for
      the relationship between the size of the population of resident T cells
      and protection. The models also suggest that repeated natural influenza
      infections cause the number of central memory CD8 T cells and the peak
      number of resident memory CD8 T cells to reach their plateaus, and while
      the former is maintained, the latter decays with time since the most
      recent infection.

      The Role of Macrophages.
PG  - e0150568
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0150568 [doi]
AB  - The World Health Organization identifies influenza as a major public
      health problem. While the strains commonly circulating in humans usually
      do not cause severe pathogenicity in healthy adults, some strains that
      have infected humans, such as H5N1, can cause high morbidity and
      mortality. Based on the severity of the disease, influenza viruses are
      sometimes categorized as either being highly pathogenic (HP) or having
      low pathogenicity (LP). The reasons why some strains are LP and others HP
      are not fully understood. While there are likely multiple mechanisms of
      interaction between the virus and the immune response that determine LP
      versus HP outcomes, we focus here on one component, namely macrophages
      (MP). There is some evidence that MP may both help fight the infection
      and become productively infected with HP influenza viruses. We developed
      mathematical models for influenza infections which explicitly included
      the dynamics and action of MP. We fit these models to viral load and
      macrophage count data from experimental infections of mice with LP and HP
      strains. Our results suggest that MP may not only help fight an influenza
      infection but may contribute to virus production in infections with HP
      viruses. We also explored the impact of combination therapies with
      antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs on HP infections. Our study
      suggests a possible mechanism of MP in determining HP versus LP outcomes,
      and how different interventions might affect infection dynamics.

PG  - 1333-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1525167113 [doi]
AB  - In advanced age, decreased CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses
      to novel pathogens and cancer is paralleled by a decline in the number
      and function of naive CTL precursors (CTLp). Although the age-related
      fall in CD8(+) T-cell numbers is well established, neither the underlying
      mechanisms nor the extent of variation for different epitope
      specificities have been defined. Furthermore, naive CD8(+) T cells
      expressing high levels of CD44 accumulate with age, but it is unknown
      whether this accumulation reflects their preferential survival or an age-
      dependent driver of CD8(+) T-cell proliferation. Here, we track the
      number and phenotype of four influenza A virus (IAV)-specific CTLp
      populations in naive C57BL/6 (B6) mice during aging, and compare T-cell
      receptor (TCR) clonal diversity for the CD44hi and CD44lo subsets of one
      such population. We show differential onset of decline for several IAV-
      specific CD8(+) T-cell populations with advanced age that parallel age-
      associated changes in the B6 immunodominance hierarchy, suggestive of
      distinct impacts of aging on different epitope-specific populations.
      Despite finding no evidence of clonal expansions in an aged, epitope-
      specific TCR repertoire, nonrandom alterations in TCR usage were
      observed, along with elevated CD5 and CD8 coreceptor expression.
      Collectively, these data demonstrate that naive CD8(+) T cells expressing
      markers of heightened self-recognition are selectively retained, but not
      clonally expanded, during aging.

TI  - Four Degrees of Separation: Social Contacts and Health Providers
      Influence the Steps to Final Diagnosis of Active Tuberculosis Patients in
      Urban Uganda.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delay in tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis adversely affects
      patients' outcomes and prolongs transmission in the community. The
      influence of social contacts on steps taken by active pulmonary TB
      patients to seek a diagnosis has not been well examined. METHODS: A
      retrospective study design was use to enroll TB patients on treatment for
      3 months or less and aged >/=18 years from 3 public clinics in Kampala,
      Uganda, from March to July 2014. Social network analysis was used to
      collect information about social contacts and health providers visited by
      patients to measure the number of steps and time between onset of
      symptoms and final diagnosis of TB. RESULTS: Of 294 TB patients, 58 %
      were male and median age was 30 (IQR: 24-38) years. The median number of
      steps was 4 (IQR: 3, 7) corresponding to 70 (IQR: 28,140) days to
      diagnosis. New patients had more steps and time to diagnosis compared
      retreatment patients (5 vs. 3, P < 0.0001; 84 vs. 46 days P < 0.0001).
      Fifty-eight percent of patients first contacted persons in their social
      network. The first step to initiate seeking care accounted for 41 % of
      the patients' time to diagnosis while visits to non-TB providers and TB
      providers (without a TB diagnosis) accounted for 34 % and 11 %
      respectively. New TB patients vs. retreatment (HR: 0.66, 95 % CI; 1.11,
      1.99), those who first contacted a non-TB health provider vs. contacting
      social network (HR: 0.72 95 % CI; 0.55, 0.95) and HIV seronegative vs.
      seropositive patients (HR: 0.70, 95 % CI; 0.53, 0.92) had a significantly
      lower likelihood of a timely final diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There were
      four degrees of separation between the onset of symptoms in a TB patient
      and a final diagnosis. Both social and provider networks of patients
      influenced the diagnostic pathways. Most delays occurred in the first
      step which represents decisions to seek help, and through interactions
      with non-TB health providers. TB control programs should strengthen
      education and active screening in the community and in health care
      settings to ensure timely diagnosis of TB.

TI  - Crossing the scale from within-host infection dynamics to between-host
      transmission fitness: a discussion of current assumptions and knowledge.
LID - 10.1098/rstb.2014.0302 [doi]
LID - 20140302 [pii]
AB  - The progression of an infection within a host determines the ability of a
      pathogen to transmit to new hosts and to maintain itself in the
      population. While the general connection between the infection dynamics
      within a host and the population-level transmission dynamics of pathogens
      is widely acknowledged, a comprehensive and quantitative understanding
      that would allow full integration of the two scales is still lacking.
      Here, we provide a brief discussion of both models and data that have
      attempted to provide quantitative mappings from within-host infection
      dynamics to transmission fitness. We present a conceptual framework and
      provide examples of studies that have taken first steps towards
      development of a quantitative framework that scales from within-host
      infections to population-level fitness of different pathogens. We hope to
      illustrate some general themes, summarize some of the recent advances
      and-maybe most importantly-discuss gaps in our ability to bridge these
      scales, and to stimulate future research on this important topic.

AB  - We analysed the reported duration of incubation and symptomatic periods
      of norovirus for a dataset of 1022 outbreaks, 64 of which reported data
      on the average incubation period and 87 on the average symptomatic
      period. We found the mean and median incubation periods for norovirus to
      be 32.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 30.9-34.6] hours and 33.5 (95% CI
      32.0-34.0) hours, respectively. For the symptomatic period we found the
      mean and median to be 44.2 (95% CI 38.9-50.7) hours and 43.0 (95% CI
      36.0-48.0) hours, respectively. We further investigated how these average
      periods were associated with several reported host, agent and
      environmental characteristics. We did not find any strong, biologically
      meaningful associations between the duration of incubation or symptomatic
      periods and the reported host, pathogen and environmental
      characteristics. Overall, we found that the distributions of incubation
      and symptomatic periods for norovirus infections are fairly constant and
      showed little differences with regard to the host, pathogen and
      environmental characteristics we analysed.

TI  - Oseltamivir Prophylaxis Reduces Inflammation and Facilitates
      Establishment of Cross-Strain Protective T Cell Memory to Influenza
      Viruses.
PG  - e0129768
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0129768 [doi]
AB  - CD8(+) T cells directed against conserved viral regions elicit broad
      immunity against distinct influenza viruses, promote rapid virus
      elimination and enhanced host recovery. The influenza neuraminidase
      inhibitor, oseltamivir, is prescribed for therapy and prophylaxis,
      although it remains unclear how the drug impacts disease severity and
      establishment of effector and memory CD8(+) T cell immunity. We dissected
      the effects of oseltamivir on viral replication, inflammation, acute
      CD8(+) T cell responses and the establishment of immunological CD8(+) T
      cell memory. In mice, ferrets and humans, the effect of osteltamivir on
      viral titre was relatively modest. However, prophylactic oseltamivir
      treatment in mice markedly reduced morbidity, innate responses,
      inflammation and, ultimately, the magnitude of effector CD8(+) T cell
      responses. Importantly, functional memory CD8(+) T cells established
      during the drug-reduced effector phase were capable of mounting robust
      recall responses. Moreover, influenza-specific memory CD4(+) T cells
      could be also recalled after the secondary challenge, while the antibody
      levels were unaffected. This provides evidence that long-term memory T
      cells can be generated during an oseltamivir-interrupted infection. The
      anti-inflammatory effect of oseltamivir was verified in H1N1-infected
      patients. Thus, in the case of an unpredicted influenza pandemic, while
      prophylactic oseltamivir treatment can reduce disease severity, the
      capacity to generate memory CD8(+) T cells specific for the newly emerged
      virus is uncompromised. This could prove especially important for any new
      influenza pandemic which often occurs in separate waves.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease with a peculiar feature: Upon
      infection with the causative agent, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB),
      most hosts enter a latent state during which no transmission of MTB to
      new hosts occurs. Only a fraction of latently infected hosts develop TB
      disease and can potentially infect new hosts. At first glance, this seems
      like a waste of transmission potential and therefore an evolutionary
      suboptimal strategy for MTB. It might be that the human immune response
      keeps MTB in check in most hosts, thereby preventing it from achieving
      its evolutionary optimum. Another possible explanation is that long
      latency and progression to disease in only a fraction of hosts are
      evolutionary beneficial to MTB by allowing it to persist better in small
      host populations. Given that MTB has co-evolved with human hosts for
      millenia or longer, it likely encountered small host populations for a
      large share of its evolutionary history and had to evolve strategies of
      persistence. Here, we use a mathematical model to show that indeed, MTB
      persistence is optimal for an intermediate duration of latency and level
      of activation. The predicted optimal level of activation is above the
      observed value, suggesting that human co-evolution has lead to host
      immunity, which keeps MTB below its evolutionary optimum.

TI  - Trade-offs between and within scales: environmental persistence and
      within-host fitness of avian influenza viruses.
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2013.3051 [doi]
LID - 20133051 [pii]
AB  - Trade-offs between different components of a pathogen's replication and
      transmission cycle are thought to be common. A number of studies have
      identified trade-offs that emerge across scales, reflecting the tension
      between strategies that optimize within-host proliferation and large-
      scale population spread. Most of these studies are theoretical in nature,
      with direct experimental tests of such cross-scale trade-offs still rare.
      Here, we report an analysis of avian influenza A viruses across scales,
      focusing on the phenotype of temperature-dependent viral persistence.
      Taking advantage of a unique dataset that reports both environmental
      virus decay rates and strain-specific viral kinetics from duck challenge
      experiments, we show that the temperature-dependent environmental decay
      rate of a strain does not impact within-host virus load. Hence, for this
      phenotype, the scales of within-host infection dynamics and between-host
      environmental persistence do not seem to interact: viral fitness may be
      optimized on each scale without cross-scale trade-offs. Instead, we
      confirm the existence of a temperature-dependent persistence trade-off on
      a single scale, with some strains favouring environmental persistence in
      water at low temperatures while others reduce sensitivity to increasing
      temperatures. We show that this temperature-dependent trade-off is a
      robust phenomenon and does not depend on the details of data analysis.
      Our findings suggest that viruses might employ different environmental
      persistence strategies, which facilitates the coexistence of diverse
      strains in ecological niches. We conclude that a better understanding of
      the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of influenza A viruses
      probably requires empirical information regarding both within-host
      dynamics and environmental traits, integrated within a combined
      ecological and within-host framework.

AB  - Human CMV still remains problematic in immunocompromised patients,
      particularly after solid organ transplantation. CMV primary disease and
      reactivation greatly increase the risks associated with incidences of
      chronic allograft rejection and decreased survival in transplant
      recipients. But whether this is due to direct viral effects, indirect
      viral effects including cross-reactive antiviral T cell immunopathology,
      or a combination of both remains undetermined. In this article, we report
      the novel TCR signature of cross-reactive HLA-A*02:01 (A2) CMV (NLVPMVATV
      [NLV])-specific CD8(+) T cells recognizing a specific array of HLA-B27
      alleles using technical advancements that combine both IFN-gamma
      secretion and multiplex nested RT-PCR for determining paired
      CDR3alpha/beta sequences from a single cell. This study represents the
      first evidence, to our knowledge, of the same A2-restricted cross-
      reactive NLV-specific TCR-alpha/beta signature
      (TRAV3TRAJ31_TRBV12-4TRBJ1-1) in two genetically distinct individuals.
      Longitudinal posttransplant monitoring of a lung transplant recipient
      (A2, CMV seropositive) who received a HLA-B27 bilateral lung allograft
      showed a dynamic expansion of the cross-reactive NLV-specific TCR
      repertoire before CMV reactivation. After resolution of the active viral
      infection, the frequency of cross-reactive NLV-specific CD8(+) T cells
      reduced to previremia levels, thereby demonstrating immune modulation of
      the T cell repertoire due to antigenic pressure. The dynamic changes in
      TCR repertoire, at a time when CMV reactivation was subclinical,
      illustrates that prospective monitoring in susceptible patients can
      reveal nuances in immune profiles that may be clinically relevant.

AB  - Inoculum dose, i.e. the number of pathogens at the beginning of an
      infection, often affects key aspects of pathogen and immune response
      dynamics. These in turn determine clinically relevant outcomes, such as
      morbidity and mortality. Despite the general recognition that inoculum
      dose is an important component of infection outcomes, we currently do not
      understand its impact in much detail. This study is intended to start
      filling this knowledge gap by analyzing inoculum dependent patterns of
      viral load dynamics in acute infections. Using experimental data for
      adenovirus and infectious bronchitis virus infections as examples, we
      demonstrate inoculum dose dependent patterns of virus dynamics. We
      analyze the data with the help of mathematical models to investigate what
      mechanisms can reproduce the patterns observed in experimental data. We
      find that models including components of both the innate and adaptive
      immune response are needed to reproduce the patterns found in the data.
      We further analyze which types of innate or adaptive immune response
      models agree with observed data. One interesting finding is that only
      models for the adaptive immune response that contain growth terms
      partially independent of viral load can properly reproduce observed
      patterns. This agrees with the idea that an antigen-independent,
      programmed response is part of the adaptive response. Our analysis
      provides useful insights into the types of model structures that are
      required to properly reproduce observed virus dynamics for varying
      inoculum doses. We suggest that such models should be taken as basis for
      future models of acute viral infections.

AB  - Budding viruses face a trade-off: virions need to efficiently attach to
      and enter uninfected cells while newly generated virions need to
      efficiently detach from infected cells. The right balance between
      attachment and detachment-the right amount of stickiness-is needed for
      maximum fitness. Here, we design and analyse a mathematical model to
      study in detail the impact of attachment and detachment rates on virus
      fitness. We apply our model to influenza, where stickiness is determined
      by a balance of the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins.
      We investigate how drugs, the adaptive immune response and vaccines
      impact influenza stickiness and fitness. Our model suggests that the
      location in the 'stickiness landscape' of the virus determines how well
      interventions such as drugs or vaccines are expected to work. We discuss
      why hypothetical NA enhancer drugs might occasionally perform better than
      the currently available NA inhibitors in reducing virus fitness. We show
      that an increased antibody or T-cell-mediated immune response leads to
      maximum fitness at higher stickiness. We further show that antibody-based
      vaccines targeting mainly HA or NA, which leads to a shift in stickiness,
      might reduce virus fitness above what can be achieved by the direct
      immunological action of the vaccine. Overall, our findings provide
      potentially useful conceptual insights for future vaccine and drug
      development and can be applied to other budding viruses beyond influenza.

      expansion vs. active selection of particular clones remains unclear.
      Using a parallel adoptive transfer protocol in combination with single
      cell analysis to define the complementarity determining region (CDR)
      3alpha and CDR3beta regions of individual T-cell receptor (TCR)
      heterodimers, we characterized the antigen-driven recall of the same
      memory CTL population in three individual recipients. This high-
      resolution analysis showed reproducible enrichment (or diminution) of
      particular TCR clonotypes across all challenged animals. These changes in
      clonal composition were TCRalpha- and beta chain-dependent and were
      directly related to the avidity of the TCR for the virus-derived peptide
      (p) + major histocompatibility complex class I molecule. Despite this
      shift in clonotype representation indicative of differential selection,
      there was no evidence of overall repertoire narrowing, suggesting a
      strategy to optimize CTL responses while safeguarding TCR diversity.

AB  - Successful replication within an infected host and successful
      transmission between hosts are key to the continued spread of most
      pathogens. Competing selection pressures exerted at these different
      scales can lead to evolutionary trade-offs between the determinants of
      fitness within and between hosts. Here, we examine such a trade-off in
      the context of influenza A viruses and the differential pressures exerted
      by temperature-dependent virus persistence. For a panel of avian
      influenza A virus strains, we find evidence for a trade-off between the
      persistence at high versus low temperatures. Combining a within-host
      model of influenza infection dynamics with a between-host transmission
      model, we study how such a trade-off affects virus fitness on the host
      population level. We show that conclusions regarding overall fitness are
      affected by the type of link assumed between the within- and between-host
      levels and the main route of transmission (direct or environmental). The
      relative importance of virulence and immune response mediated virus
      clearance are also found to influence the fitness impacts of virus
      persistence at low versus high temperatures. Based on our results, we
      predict that if transmission occurs mainly directly and scales linearly
      with virus load, and virulence or immune responses are negligible, the
      evolutionary pressure for influenza viruses to evolve toward good
      persistence at high within-host temperatures dominates. For all other
      scenarios, influenza viruses with good environmental persistence at low
      temperatures seem to be favored.

AB  - Ecology is typically thought of as the study of interactions organisms
      have with each other and their environment and is focused on the
      distribution and abundance of organisms both within and between
      environments. On a molecular level, the capacity to probe analogous
      questions in the field of T-cell immunology is imperative as we acquire
      substantial datasets both on epitope-specific T-cell populations through
      high-resolution analyses of T-cell receptor (TCR) use and on global
      T-cell populations analyzed via high-throughput DNA sequencing. Here, we
      present the innovative application of existing statistical measures (used
      typically in the field of ecology), together with unique statistical
      analyses, to comprehensively assess how the naive epitope-specific CD8(+)
      cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) repertoire translates to that found
      following an influenza-virus-specific immune response. Such interrogation
      of our extensive, cumulated TCR CDR3beta sequence datasets, derived from
      both naive and immune CD8(+) T-cell populations specific for four
      different influenza-derived epitopes (D(b)NP(366), influenza
      nucleoprotein amino acid residues 366-374; D(b)PA(224), influenza acid
      polymerase amino acid residues 224-233; D(b)PB1-F2(62), influenza
      polymerase B 1 reading frame 2 amino acid residues 62-70; K(b)NS2(114),
      and influenza nonstructural protein 2 amino acid residues 114-121),
      demonstrates that epitope-specific TCR use in an antiviral immune
      response is the consequence of a complex interplay between the intrinsic
      characteristics of the naive cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor pool and
      extrinsic (likely antigen driven) influences, the contribution of which
      varies in an epitope-specific fashion.

PG  - 1305-11
LID - 10.1016/j.meegid.2012.05.003 [doi]
AB  - Coronaviruses, which are single stranded, positive sense RNA viruses, are
      responsible for a wide variety of existing and emerging diseases in
      humans and other animals. The gammacoronaviruses primarily infect avian
      hosts. Within this genus of coronaviruses, the avian coronavirus
      infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a highly infectious upper-
      respiratory tract disease in commercial poultry. IBV shows rapid
      evolution in chickens, frequently producing new antigenic types, which
      adds to the multiple serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect.
      Rapid evolution in IBV is facilitated by strong selection, large
      population sizes and high genetic diversity within hosts, and
      transmission bottlenecks between hosts. Genetic diversity within a host
      arises primarily by mutation, which includes substitutions, insertions
      and deletions. Mutations are caused both by the high error rate, and
      limited proof reading capability, of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-
      polymerase, and by recombination. Recombination also generates new
      haplotype diversity by recombining existing variants. Rapid evolution of
      avian coronavirus IBV makes this virus extremely difficult to diagnose
      and control, but also makes it an excellent model system to study viral
      genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of
      coronaviruses in their natural host.

TI  - Severe outcomes are associated with genogroup 2 genotype 4 norovirus
      outbreaks: a systematic literature review.
PG  - 189-93
LID - 10.1093/cid/cis372 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Noroviruses (NoVs) are the most common cause of epidemic
      gastroenteritis; however, the relative impacts of individual factors
      underlying severe illness are poorly understood. This report reviews
      published NoV outbreak reports to quantify hospitalization and mortality
      rates and assess their relationship with outbreak setting, transmission
      route, and strain. METHODS: Using a string of terms related to
      "norovirus" and "outbreak," we 2435 nonduplicate articles identified in
      PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Knowledge published between January 1993 and
      June 2011. Inclusion criteria included outbreaks with a minimum of 2 ill
      persons with a common exposure and at least 1 reverse-transcription
      polymerase chain reaction-confirmed case of NoV disease. Univariate
      analyses were performed, and multivariable models were fitted to estimate
      the independent effect of each factor. RESULTS: We analyzed 843 NoV
      outbreaks reported in 233 published articles from 45 countries. Based
      upon 71724 illnesses, 501 hospitalizations, and 45 deaths, overall
      hospitalization and mortality rates were 0.54% and 0.06%, respectively.
      In multivariate analysis, genogroup 2 genotype 4 (GII.4) NoV strains were
      associated with higher hospitalization (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 9.4;
      95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1-14.4; P< .001) and mortality rates
      (IRR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.6; P = .01). Deaths were much more likely to
      occur in outbreaks occurring in healthcare facilities (IRR, 60; 95% CI,
      6-109; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggests that hospitalizations
      and deaths were more likely in outbreaks associated with GII.4 viruses,
      independent of other factors, and underscores the importance of
      developing vaccines against GII.4 viruses to prevent severe disease
      outcomes.

TI  - How to minimize the attack rate during multiple influenza outbreaks in a
      heterogeneous population.
PG  - e36573
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0036573 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: If repeated interventions against multiple outbreaks are not
      feasible, there is an optimal level of control during the first outbreak.
      Any control measures above that optimal level will lead to an outcome
      that may be as sub-optimal as that achieved by an intervention that is
      too weak. We studied this scenario in more detail. METHOD: An age-
      stratified ordinary-differential-equation model was constructed to study
      infectious disease outbreaks and control in a population made up of two
      groups, adults and children. The model was parameterized using influenza
      as an example. This model was used to simulate two consecutive outbreaks
      of the same infectious disease, with an intervention applied only during
      the first outbreak, and to study how cumulative attack rates were
      influenced by population composition, strength of inter-group
      transmission, and different ways of triggering and implementing the
      interventions. We assumed that recovered individuals are fully immune and
      the intervention does not confer immunity. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The
      optimal intervention depended on coupling between the two population sub-
      groups, the length, strength and timing of the intervention, and the
      population composition. Population heterogeneity affected intervention
      strategies only for very low cross-transmission between groups. At more
      realistic values, coupling between the groups led to synchronization of
      outbreaks and therefore intervention strategies that were optimal in
      reducing the attack rates for each subgroup and the population overall
      coincided. For a sustained intervention of low efficacy, early
      intervention was found to be best, while at high efficacies, a delayed
      start was better. For short interventions, a delayed start was always
      advantageous, independent of the intervention efficacy. For most
      scenarios, starting the intervention after a certain cumulative
      proportion of children were infected seemed more robust in achieving
      close to optimal outcomes compared to a strategy that used a specified
      duration after an outbreak's beginning as the trigger.

AB  - Most mathematical models used to study the dynamics of influenza A have
      thus far focused on the between-host population level, with the aim to
      inform public health decisions regarding issues such as drug and social
      distancing intervention strategies, antiviral stockpiling or vaccine
      distribution. Here, we investigate mathematical modeling of influenza
      infection spread at a different scale; namely that occurring within an
      individual host or a cell culture. We review the models that have been
      developed in the last decades and discuss their contributions to our
      understanding of the dynamics of influenza infections. We review kinetic
      parameters (e.g., viral clearance rate, lifespan of infected cells) and
      values obtained through fitting mathematical models, and contrast them
      with values obtained directly from experiments. We explore the symbiotic
      role of mathematical models and experimental assays in improving our
      quantitative understanding of influenza infection dynamics. We also
      discuss the challenges in developing better, more comprehensive models
      for the course of influenza infections within a host or cell culture.
      Finally, we explain the contributions of such modeling efforts to
      important public health issues, and suggest future modeling studies that
      can help to address additional questions relevant to public health.

TI  - Influenza epitope-specific CD8+ T cell avidity, but not cytokine
      polyfunctionality, can be determined by TCRbeta clonotype.
PG  - 6850-6
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1002025 [doi]
AB  - Cytokine polyfunctionality has recently emerged as a correlate of
      effective CTL immunity to viruses and tumors. Although the determinants
      of polyfunctionality remain unclear, there are published instances of a
      link between the production of multiple effector molecules and the
      peptide plus MHC class I molecule avidity of T cell populations.
      Influenza A virus infection of C57BL/6J mice induces CTL populations
      specific for multiple viral epitopes, each with varying proportions of
      monofunctional (IFN-gamma(+) only) or polyfunctional (IFN-gamma(+)TNF-
      alpha(+)IL-2(+)) CTLs. In this study, we probe the link between TCR
      avidity and polyfunctionality for two dominant influenza epitopes
      (D(b)NP(366) and D(b)PA(224)) by sequencing the TCR CDR3beta regions of
      influenza-specific IFN-gamma(+) versus IFN-gamma(+)IL-2(+) cells, or
      total tetramer(+) versus high-avidity CTLs (as defined by the peptide
      plus MHC class I molecule-TCR dissociation rate). Preferential selection
      for particular clonotypes was evident for the high-avidity
      D(b)PA(224)-specific set but not for any of the other subsets examined.
      These data suggest that factors other than TCRbeta sequence influence
      cytokine profiles and demonstrate no link between differential avidity
      and polyfunctionality.

AB  - Although the influenza A virus has been extensively studied, a
      quantitative understanding of the infection dynamics is still lacking. To
      make progress in this direction, we designed several mathematical models
      and compared them with data from influenza A infections of mice. We find
      that the immune response (IR) plays an important part in the infection
      dynamics. Both an innate and an adaptive IR are required to provide
      adequate explanation of the data. In contrast, regrowth of epithelial
      cells did not seem to be an important mechanism on the time scale of the
      infection. We also find that different model variants for both innate and
      adaptive responses fit the data well, indicating the need for additional
      data to allow further model discrimination.

      smooth versus rugged fitness landscapes.
PG  - 236
LID - 10.1186/1471-2148-9-236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is commonly thought that large asexual populations evolve
      more rapidly than smaller ones, due to their increased rate of beneficial
      mutations. Less clear is how population size influences the level of
      fitness an asexual population can attain. Here, we simulate the evolution
      of bacteria in repeated serial passage experiments to explore how
      features such as fitness landscape ruggedness, the size of the mutational
      target under selection, and the mutation supply rate, interact to affect
      the evolution of microbial populations of different sizes. RESULTS: We
      find that if the fitness landscape has many local peaks, there can be a
      trade-off between the rate of adaptation and the potential to reach high
      fitness peaks. This result derives from the fact that whereas large
      populations evolve mostly deterministically and often become trapped on
      local fitness peaks, smaller populations can follow more stochastic
      evolutionary paths and thus locate higher fitness peaks. We also find
      that the target size of adaptation and the mutation rate interact with
      population size to influence the trade-off between rate of adaptation and
      final fitness. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the optimal population
      size for adaptation depends on the details of the environment and on the
      importance of either the ability to evolve rapidly or to reach high
      fitness levels.

AB  - Influenza infections often predispose individuals to consecutive
      bacterial infections. Both during seasonal and pandemic influenza
      outbreaks, morbidity and mortality due to secondary bacterial infections
      can be substantial. With the help of a mathematical model, we investigate
      the potential impact of such bacterial infections during an influenza
      pandemic, and we analyze how antiviral and antibacterial treatment or
      prophylaxis affect morbidity and mortality. We consider different
      scenarios for the spread of bacteria, the emergence of antiviral
      resistance, and different levels of severity for influenza infections
      (1918-like and 2009-like). We find that while antibacterial intervention
      strategies are unlikely to play an important role in reducing the overall
      number of cases, such interventions can lead to a significant reduction
      in mortality and in the number of bacterial infections. Antibacterial
      interventions become even more important if one considers the--very
      likely--scenario that during a pandemic outbreak, influenza strains
      resistant to antivirals emerge. Overall, our study suggests that pandemic
      preparedness plans should consider intervention strategies based on
      antibacterial treatment or prophylaxis through drugs or vaccines as part
      of the overall control strategy. A major caveat for our results is the
      lack of data that would allow precise estimation of many of the model
      parameters. As our results show, this leads to very large uncertainty in
      model outcomes. As we discuss, precise assessment of the impact of
      antibacterial strategies during an influenza pandemic will require the
      collection of further data to better estimate key parameters, especially
      those related to the bacterial infections and the impact of antibacterial
      intervention strategies.

PG  - 447-54
LID - 10.1098/rsif.2008.0258 [doi]
AB  - Communication between cells is crucial for immune responses. An important
      means of communication during viral infections is the presentation of
      viral antigen on the surface of an infected cell. Recently, it has been
      shown that antigen can be shared between infected and uninfected cells
      through gap junctions, connexin-based channels, that allow the transport
      of small molecules. The uninfected cell receiving antigen can present it
      on its surface. Cells presenting viral antigen are detected and killed by
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The killing of uninfected cells can lead to
      increased immunopathology. However, the immune response might also profit
      from killing those uninfected bystander cells. One benefit might be the
      removal of future 'virus factories'. Another benefit might be through the
      creation of 'firebreaks', areas void of target cells, which increase the
      diffusion time of free virions, making their clearance more likely. Here,
      we use theoretical models and simulations to explore how the mechanism of
      gap junction-mediated antigen transport (GMAT) affects the dynamics of
      the virus and immune response. We show that under the assumption of a
      well-mixed system, GMAT leads to increased immunopathology, which always
      outweighs the benefit of reduced virus production due to the removal of
      future virus factories. By contrast, a spatially explicit model leads to
      quite different results. Here we find that the firebreak mechanism
      reduces both viral load and immunopathology. Our study thus shows the
      potential benefits of GMAT and illustrates how spatial effects may be
      crucial for the quantitative understanding of infection dynamics and
      immune responses.

      resistance.
PG  - 655-62
LID - 10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.10.025 [doi]
AB  - For many bacterial infections, drug resistant mutants are likely present
      by the time antibiotic treatment starts. Nevertheless, such infections
      are often successfully cleared. It is commonly assumed that this is due
      to the combined action of drug and immune response, the latter
      facilitating clearance of the resistant population. However, most studies
      of drug resistance emergence during antibiotic treatment focus almost
      exclusively on the dynamics of bacteria and the drug and neglect the
      contribution of immune defenses. Here, we develop and analyze several
      mathematical models that explicitly include an immune response. We
      consider different types of immune responses and investigate how each
      impacts the emergence of resistance. We show that an immune response that
      retains its strength despite a strong drug-induced decline of bacteria
      numbers considerably reduces the emergence of resistance, narrows the
      mutant selection window, and mitigates the effects of non-adherence to
      treatment. Additionally, we show that compared to an immune response that
      kills bacteria at a constant rate, one that trades reduced killing at
      high bacterial load for increased killing at low bacterial load is
      sometimes preferable. We discuss the predictions and hypotheses derived
      from this study and how they can be tested experimentally.

AB  - Antiviral drugs, most notably the neuraminidase inhibitors, are an
      important component of control strategies aimed to prevent or limit any
      future influenza pandemic. The potential large-scale use of antiviral
      drugs brings with it the danger of drug resistance evolution. A number of
      recent studies have shown that the emergence of drug-resistant influenza
      could undermine the usefulness of antiviral drugs for the control of an
      epidemic or pandemic outbreak. While these studies have provided
      important insights, the inherently stochastic nature of resistance
      generation and spread, as well as the potential for ongoing evolution of
      the resistant strain have not been fully addressed. Here, we study a
      stochastic model of drug resistance emergence and consecutive evolution
      of the resistant strain in response to antiviral control during an
      influenza pandemic. We find that taking into consideration the ongoing
      evolution of the resistant strain does not increase the probability of
      resistance emergence; however, it increases the total number of infecteds
      if a resistant outbreak occurs. Our study further shows that taking
      stochasticity into account leads to results that can differ from
      deterministic models. Specifically, we find that rapid and strong control
      cannot only contain a drug sensitive outbreak, it can also prevent a
      resistant outbreak from occurring. We find that the best control strategy
      is early intervention heavily based on prophylaxis at a level that leads
      to outbreak containment. If containment is not possible, mitigation works
      best at intermediate levels of antiviral control. Finally, we show that
      the results are not very sensitive to the way resistance generation is
      modeled.

      microbial populations.
PG  - 2193-200
LID - 10.1534/genetics.108.093013 [doi]
AB  - The ability of microbial populations to increase fitness through fixation
      of mutants with an increased growth rate has been well described. In
      experimental studies, this is often the only way fitness can be
      increased. In natural settings, however, fitness can also be improved by
      increasing the ability of the microbe to transmit from one host to the
      next. For many pathogens, transmission includes a phase outside the host
      during which they need to survive before the chance of reinfecting a new
      host occurs. In such a situation, a reduced death rate during this phase
      will lead to improved fitness. Here, we compute the fixation probability
      of mutants that better survive the transmission bottleneck during the
      evolution of microbial populations. We derive analytical results that
      show that transmission mutants are often likely to occur and that their
      importance relative to growth mutants increases as the population decline
      during the transmission phase increases. We confirm our theoretical
      results with numerical simulations and suggest specific experiments that
      can be done to test our predictions.

TI  - A simple mathematical model helps to explain the immunodominance of CD8 T
      cells in influenza A virus infections.
PG  - 7768-72
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00653-08 [doi]
AB  - Understanding immunodominance, the phenomenon of epitope-specific T cells
      expanding in an often distinctly hierarchical fashion, is important for
      the design of T-cell-based intervention strategies. Several recent
      studies have investigated immunodominance of H-2D(b)-restricted CD8(+) T
      cells specific for the nucleoprotein NP366 and acid polymerase PA224
      epitopes during influenza A virus infection of C57BL/6 mice. CD8(+) T
      cells specific for these two epitopes are codominant during primary
      infection; NP366 dominates during secondary infection. While a number of
      explanations for this observation have been proposed, none of them can
      fully account for all the observed data. In this article, we use a simple
      mathematical model to explain the seemingly inconsistent data. We show
      that the dynamic interactions between CD8(+) T cells and antigen
      presentation lead to a situation where CD8(+) T cells are limiting during
      the initial response whereas antigen is limiting in the secondary
      response. This "numbers game" between antigen and CD8(+) T cells can
      reproduce the observed immunodominance of the NP336- and PA224-specific
      CD8(+) T cells, thereby explaining the reported experimental data.

TI  - Heterogeneous adaptive trajectories of small populations on complex
      fitness landscapes.
PG  - e1715
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0001715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Small populations are thought to be adaptively handicapped,
      not only because they suffer more from deleterious mutations but also
      because they have limited access to new beneficial mutations,
      particularly those conferring large benefits. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
      FINDINGS: Here, we test this widely held conjecture using both
      simulations and experiments with small and large bacterial populations
      evolving in either a simple or a complex nutrient environment. Consistent
      with expectations, we find that small populations are adaptively
      constrained in the simple environment; however, in the complex
      environment small populations not only follow more heterogeneous adaptive
      trajectories, but can also attain higher fitness than the large
      populations. Large populations are constrained to near deterministic
      fixation of rare large-benefit mutations. While such determinism speeds
      adaptation on the smooth adaptive landscape represented by the simple
      environment, it can limit the ability of large populations from
      effectively exploring the underlying topography of rugged adaptive
      landscapes characterized by complex environments. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results show that adaptive constraints often faced by small populations
      can be circumvented during evolution on rugged adaptive landscapes.

TI  - Neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in influenza: assessing the danger of
      its generation and spread.
PG  - e240
AB  - Neuraminidase Inhibitors (NI) are currently the most effective drugs
      against influenza. Recent cases of NI resistance are a cause for concern.
      To assess the danger of NI resistance, a number of studies have reported
      the fraction of treated patients from which resistant strains could be
      isolated. Unfortunately, those results strongly depend on the details of
      the experimental protocol. Additionally, knowing the fraction of patients
      harboring resistance is not too useful by itself. Instead, we want to
      know how likely it is that an infected patient can generate a resistant
      infection in a secondary host, and how likely it is that the resistant
      strain subsequently spreads. While estimates for these parameters can
      often be obtained from epidemiological data, such data is lacking for NI
      resistance in influenza. Here, we use an approach that does not rely on
      epidemiological data. Instead, we combine data from influenza infections
      of human volunteers with a mathematical framework that allows estimation
      of the parameters that govern the initial generation and subsequent
      spread of resistance. We show how these parameters are influenced by
      changes in drug efficacy, timing of treatment, fitness of the resistant
      strain, and details of virus and immune system dynamics. Our study
      provides estimates for parameters that can be directly used in
      mathematical and computational models to study how NI usage might lead to
      the emergence and spread of resistance in the population. We find that
      the initial generation of resistant cases is most likely lower than the
      fraction of resistant cases reported. However, we also show that the
      results depend strongly on the details of the within-host dynamics of
      influenza infections, and most importantly, the role the immune system
      plays. Better knowledge of the quantitative dynamics of the immune
      response during influenza infections will be crucial to further improve
      the results.

TI  - Gap junction-mediated antigen transport in immune responses.
PG  - 463-6
AB  - Communication between cells is a crucial part of the immune response. The
      importance of cytokines and immunological synapses for this purpose has
      long been recognized. Connexin-based gap junctions that allow exchange of
      molecules between adjacent cells also seem to have an important role.
      Recent work suggests that gap junction-mediated antigen transport might
      be a mechanism of immune-response regulation. Here, we discuss this idea
      in more detail and suggest possible ways in which this mechanism might
      have both positive and negative impacts during an immune response.

TI  - What is the best control strategy for multiple infectious disease
      outbreaks?
PG  - 833-7
AB  - Effective control of infectious disease outbreaks is an important public
      health goal. In a number of recent studies, it has been shown how
      different intervention measures like travel restrictions, school
      closures, treatment and prophylaxis might allow us to control outbreaks
      of diseases, such as SARS, pandemic influenza and others. In these
      studies, control of a single outbreak is considered. It is, however, not
      clear how one should handle a situation where multiple outbreaks are
      likely to occur. Here, we identify the best control strategy for such a
      situation. We further discuss ways in which such a strategy can be
      implemented to achieve additional public health objectives.

TI  - Transmissibility and mortality impact of epidemic and pandemic influenza,
      with emphasis on the unusually deadly 1951 epidemic.
PG  - 6701-7
AB  - There are important gaps in our current understanding of the influenza
      virus behavior. In particular, it remains unclear why some inter-pandemic
      seasons are associated with unusually high mortality impact, sometimes
      comparable to that of pandemics. Here we compare the epidemiological
      patterns of the unusually deadly 1951 influenza epidemic (A/H1N1) in
      England and Wales and Canada with those of surrounding epidemic and
      pandemic seasons, in terms of overall mortality impact and
      transmissibility. Based on the statistical and mathematical analysis of
      vital statistics and morbidity epidemic curves in these two countries, we
      show that the 1951 epidemic was associated with both higher mortality
      impact and higher transmissibility than the 1957 and 1968 pandemics.
      Surprisingly in Liverpool, considered the 'epicenter' of the severe 1951
      epidemic, the mortality impact and transmissibility even surpassed the
      1918 pandemic.

TI  - The role of compensatory mutations in the emergence of drug resistance.
PG  - e137
AB  - Pathogens that evolve resistance to drugs usually have reduced fitness.
      However, mutations that largely compensate for this reduction in fitness
      often arise. We investigate how these compensatory mutations affect
      population-wide resistance emergence as a function of drug treatment.
      Using a model of gonorrhea transmission dynamics, we obtain generally
      applicable, qualitative results that show how compensatory mutations lead
      to more likely and faster resistance emergence. We further show that
      resistance emergence depends on the level of drug use in a strongly
      nonlinear fashion. We also discuss what data need to be obtained to allow
      future quantitative predictions of resistance emergence.

TI  - Transient dynamics and nonlinear stability of spatially extended systems.
PG  - 036302
AB  - As studies of various systems have shown, the sole focus on the
      eigenvalues in a linear stability analysis can be misleading, especially
      when the dynamics of disturbances is characterized by strong transient
      growth. The aim of this paper is to extend the generalized stability
      analysis, in the context of spatially extended systems, by examining the
      role of the nonlinear terms in the destabilization process. The critical
      noise level leading to destabilization is often found to scale as a power
      of the magnitude of transient amplification. In what follows we show that
      the power law exponent sensitively depends on the type of nonlinear terms
      and their potential for generating self-sustaining noise amplification
      cycles (bootstrapping). We find, however, that the exponents are not
      universal and also depend on the more subtle details of the transient
      dynamics. We also show that the basin of attraction of a spatially
      uniform state is bounded by the stable manifold(s) of nearby saddle(s)
      which play a major role in the transition.

TI  - Pattern selection and control via localized feedback.
PG  - 066208
AB  - Many theoretical analyses of feedback control of pattern-forming systems
      assume that feedback is applied at every spatial location, something that
      is often difficult to accomplish in experiments. This paper considers an
      experimentally more feasible scenario where feedback is applied at a
      sparse array of discrete spatial locations. We show how such feedback can
      be computed analytically for a class of reaction-diffusion systems and
      use generalized linear stability analysis to determine how dense the
      actuator array needs to be to select or maintain control of a given
      pattern state in the presence of noise. The one-dimensional Swift-
      Hohenberg equation is used to illustrate our theoretical results and
      explain earlier experimental observations on the control of the Rayleigh-
      Benard convection.

TI  - Non-normality and the localized control of extended systems.
PG  - 067201
AB  - The idea of controlling the dynamics of spatially extended systems using
      a small number of localized perturbations is very appealing-such a setup
      is easy to implement in practice. However, when the distance between
      controllers generating the perturbations becomes large, control fails due
      to extreme sensitivity of the system to noise. This sensitivity results
      from strong non-normality of the evolution operator governing the
      dynamics of disturbances in the controlled system. We investigate how
      non-normality can arise in an originally normal system and study how the
      noise amplification depends on the distance between controllers.

TI  - Spectral theory for the failure of linear control in a nonlinear
      stochastic system.
PG  - 065301
AB  - We consider the failure of localized control in a nonlinear spatially
      extended system caused by extremely small amounts of noise. It is shown
      that this failure occurs as a result of a nonlinear instability.
      Nonlinear instabilities can occur in systems described by linearly stable
      but strongly non-normal evolution operators. In spatially extended
      systems the non-normality manifests itself in two different but
      complementary ways: transient amplification and spectral focusing of
      disturbances. We show that temporal and spatial aspects of the non-
      normality and the type of nonlinearity are all crucially important to
      understand and describe the mechanism of nonlinear instability. Presented
      results are expected to apply equally to other physical systems where
      strong non-normality is due to the presence of mean flow rather than the
      action of control.
