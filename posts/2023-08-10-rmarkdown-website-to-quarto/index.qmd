# Motivation

I'm on the process of switching everything I write to Quarto (as much as I can). A while ago, I switched my main, formerly Hugo-based website [and wrote about it here](). 

I also have a number of fairly simple RMarkdown based websites hosted on GitHub. They mostly work fine as they are, but I wanted to switch the site for my [Modern Applied Data Analysis class]() over to Quarto. Since I expect I'll need to do that again in the future, I figured I better write it down. Turning it into a blog post might help others, too.


# Who this is (not) for

This is for anyone who has an [R Markdown based website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-13.html) hosted on GitHub and wants to move it to Quarto. This is not an introductory post, more of a 'how-to'. 


# Changing the configuration file

R Markdown websites use the `_site.yml` file for configuration and layout details. This needs to be replaced by a `_quarto.yml` file. You can copy most of the content over, and then change the formatting so it adheres to the `Quarto` style. [This page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) of the Quarto documentation is your friend.



# Changing the R Markdown files to Quarto

You could keep your `Rmd` files.



# Converting YAML sections

I had to do a bunch of manual conversions of all the `index.qmd` files that go with each post and presentation. It was a bit tedious but not too bad. Basically, I had to remove anything from the YAML that was specific for Hugo/Wowchemy and format it to have the fields [supported by Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html). I found [Danielle's post](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/) to be helpful for a quick orientation. (Note that she converts from Distill, so her starting point is slightly different, but the new Quarto entries are the same.)


# More options

You can add more features, such as a 'not found' page or comments.


# Publishing with GitHub

Nothing really changes here, you still render your website with Quarto into the `docs` folder, push to GitHub, and it will be served from that folder.



# Summary

Overall, it wasn't too hard.

# Acknowledgments

It should be obvious that I owe a lot of these ideas to the blog posts and other resources I cite above. So thanks to those who tried it before me and wrote about it!
