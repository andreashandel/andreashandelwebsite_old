# andreashandel-tidytuesday1

My exploration of the TidyTuesday data from 10/1/2019.

Part of an [exercise](https://andreashandel.github.io/MADAcourse/Exercise_Tidy_Tuesday_1.html) students were asked to do in my [Modern Applied Data Analysis course](https://andreashandel.github.io/MADAcourse/). 

All files are in this repository, you can see [my analysis displayed as website here](https://andreashandel.github.io/tidytuesday-2019-10/).
