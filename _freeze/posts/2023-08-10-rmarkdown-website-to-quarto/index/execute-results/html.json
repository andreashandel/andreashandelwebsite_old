This is a write-up so I'll remember when I have to do it again in the future.\nauthor: Andreas Handel\ndate: '2023-08-10'\ndate-modified: '2023-08-10'\naliases: \n  - ../quarto-website-migration/\ncategories: \n- Quarto\n- RMarkdown\n- Website\nimage: \"featured.png\"\nengine: knitr\n---\n\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nI'm on the process of switching everything I write to Quarto (as much as I can). A while ago, I switched my main, formerly Hugo-based website [and wrote about it here](). \n\nI also have a number of fairly simple RMarkdown based websites hosted on GitHub. They mostly work fine as they are, but I wanted to switch the site for my [Modern Applied Data Analysis class]() over to Quarto. Since I expect I'll need to do that again in the future, I figured I better write it down. Turning it into a blog post might help others, too.\n\n\n# Who this is (not) for\n\nThis is for anyone who has an [R Markdown based website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-13.html) hosted on GitHub and wants to move it to Quarto. This is not an introductory post, more of a 'how-to'. \n\n\n# Changing the configuration file\n\nR Markdown websites use the `_site.yml` file for configuration and layout details. This needs to be replaced by a `_quarto.yml` file. You can copy most of the content over, and then change the formatting so it adheres to the `Quarto` style. [This page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) of the Quarto documentation is your friend.\n\n\n\n# Changing the R Markdown files to Quarto\n\nYou could keep your `Rmd` files.\n\n\n\n# Converting YAML sections\n\nI had to do a bunch of manual conversions of all the `index.qmd` files that go with each post and presentation. It was a bit tedious but not too bad. Basically, I had to remove anything from the YAML that was specific for Hugo/Wowchemy and format it to have the fields [supported by Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html). I found [Danielle's post](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/) to be helpful for a quick orientation. (Note that she converts from Distill, so her starting point is slightly different, but the new Quarto entries are the same.)\n\n\n# More options\n\nYou can add more features, such as a 'not found' page or comments.\n\n\n# Publishing with GitHub\n\nNothing really changes here, you still render your website with Quarto into the `docs` folder, push to GitHub, and it will be served from that folder.\n\n\n\n# Summary\n\nOverall, it wasn't too hard. \n\n\n# Further resources\n\n\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nIt should be obvious that I owe a lot of these ideas to the blog posts and other resources I cite above. So thanks to those who tried it before me and wrote about it!\n\n",
