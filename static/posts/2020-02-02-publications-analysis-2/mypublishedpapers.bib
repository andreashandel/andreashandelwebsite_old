  abstract = {Most mathematical models used to study the dynamics of influenza A have thus far focused on the between-host population level, with the aim to inform public health decisions regarding issues such as drug and social distancing intervention strategies, antiviral stockpiling or vaccine distribution. Here, we investigate mathematical modeling of influenza infection spread at a different scale; namely that occurring within an individual host or a cell culture. We review the models that have been developed in the last decades and discuss their contributions to our understanding of the dynamics of influenza infections. We review kinetic parameters (e.g., viral clearance rate, lifespan of infected cells) and values obtained through fitting mathematical models, and contrast them with values obtained directly from experiments. We explore the symbiotic role of mathematical models and experimental assays in improving our quantitative understanding of influenza infection dynamics. We also discuss the challenges in developing better, more comprehensive models for the course of influenza infections within a host or cell culture. Finally, we explain the contributions of such modeling efforts to important public health issues, and suggest future modeling studies that can help to address additional questions relevant to public health.},

  abstract = {Methods: We prospectively recruited 300 students at a university health clinic who presented with cough and 1 influenza-like illness symptom between December 2016 and February 2017 to receive care guided by a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Of the 300 patients receiving the PCR test, 264 had complete medical records and were compared to 771 who received usual care. We used a logistic regression model to identify whether PCR guided care was associated with guideline consistent care, based on the appropriate use of oseltamivir and antibiotics. We also assessed whether PCR guided care decreased the likelihood of return visits within 2 weeks by patients.
Results: Logistic regression revealed that the odds of receiving guideline supported care did not significantly increase for patients who received PCR guided care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.24; 95\% CI, 0.83\textendash 1.88). It significantly decreased the likelihood of an antibiotic prescription (aOR, 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.40 \textendash{} 0.94), increased the likelihood of receiving oseltamivir (aOR, 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.09 \textendash 2.28), and decreased the likelihood of return visit within 2 weeks (aOR, 0.19; 95\% CI, 0.04 \textendash{} 0.81).
Conclusions: The use of a rapid PCR test did not significantly improve the likelihood of guideline consistent care.

  abstract = {Background. Noroviruses (NoVs) are the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis; however, the relative impacts of individual factors underlying severe illness are poorly understood. This report reviews published NoV outbreak reports to quantify hospitalization and mortality rates and assess their relationship with outbreak setting, transmission route, and strain.
Methods. Using a string of terms related to ``norovirus'' and ``outbreak,'' we 2435 nonduplicate articles identified in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Knowledge published between January 1993 and June 2011. Inclusion criteria included outbreaks with a minimum of 2 ill persons with a common exposure and at least 1 reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction\textendash confirmed case of NoV disease. Univariate analyses were performed, and multivariable models were fitted to estimate the independent effect of each factor.
Results. We analyzed 843 NoV outbreaks reported in 233 published articles from 45 countries. Based upon 71 724 illnesses, 501 hospitalizations, and 45 deaths, overall hospitalization and mortality rates were 0.54\% and 0.06\%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, genogroup 2 genotype 4 (GII.4) NoV strains were associated with higher hospitalization (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 9.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 6.1\textendash 14.4; P {$<$} .001) and mortality rates (IRR, 3.1; 95\% CI, 1.3\textendash 7.6; P = .01). Deaths were much more likely to occur in outbreaks occurring in healthcare facilities (IRR, 60; 95\% CI, 6\textendash 109; P = .01).
Conclusions. Our review suggests that hospitalizations and deaths were more likely in outbreaks associated with GII.4 viruses, independent of other factors, and underscores the importance of developing vaccines against GII.4 viruses to prevent severe disease outcomes.},

In experimental studies, this is often the only way fitness can be increased. In natural settings, however, fitness can also be improved by increasing the ability of the microbe to transmit from one host to the next. For many pathogens, transmission includes a phase outside the host during which they need to survive before the chance of reinfecting a new host occurs. In such a situation, a reduced death rate during this phase will lead to improved fitness. Here, we compute the fixation probability of mutants that better survive the transmission bottleneck during the evolution of microbial populations. We derive analytical results that show that transmission mutants are often likely to occur and that their importance relative to growth mutants increases as the population decline during the transmission phase increases. We confirm our theoretical results with numerical simulations and suggest specific experiments that can be done to test our predictions.},

  abstract = {Background: It is commonly thought that large asexual populations evolve more rapidly than smaller ones, due to their increased rate of beneficial mutations. Less clear is how population size influences the level of fitness an asexual population can attain. Here, we simulate the evolution of bacteria in repeated serial passage experiments to explore how features such as fitness landscape ruggedness, the size of the mutational target under selection, and the mutation supply rate, interact to affect the evolution of microbial populations of different sizes.
Results: We find that if the fitness landscape has many local peaks, there can be a trade-off between the rate of adaptation and the potential to reach high fitness peaks. This result derives from the fact that whereas large populations evolve mostly deterministically and often become trapped on local fitness peaks, smaller populations can follow more stochastic evolutionary paths and thus locate higher fitness peaks. We also find that the target size of adaptation and the mutation rate interact with population size to influence the trade-off between rate of adaptation and final fitness.
Conclusion: Our study suggests that the optimal population size for adaptation depends on the details of the environment and on the importance of either the ability to evolve rapidly or to reach high fitness levels.},

Both during seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks, morbidity and mortality due to secondary bacterial infections can be substantial. With the help of a mathematical model, we investigate the potential impact of such bacterial infections during an influenza pandemic, and we analyze how antiviral and antibacterial treatment or prophylaxis affect morbidity and mortality. We consider different scenarios for the spread of bacteria, the emergence of antiviral resistance, and different levels of severity for influenza infections (1918-like and 2009-like). We find that while antibacterial intervention strategies are unlikely to play an important role in reducing the overall number of cases, such interventions can lead to a significant reduction in mortality and in the number of bacterial infections. Antibacterial interventions become even more important if one considers the\textendash very likely\textendash scenario that during a pandemic outbreak, influenza strains resistant to antivirals emerge. Overall, our study suggests that pandemic preparedness plans should consider intervention strategies based on antibacterial treatment or prophylaxis through drugs or vaccines as part of the overall control strategy. A major caveat for our results is the lack of data that would allow precise estimation of many of the model parameters. As our results show, this leads to very large uncertainty in model outcomes. As we discuss, precise assessment of the impact of antibacterial strategies during an influenza pandemic will require the collection of further data to better estimate key parameters, especially those related to the bacterial infections and the impact of antibacterial intervention strategies.},

  abstract = {Antiviral drugs, most notably the neuraminidase inhibitors, are an important component of control strategies aimed to prevent or limit any future influenza pandemic. The potential large-scale use of antiviral drugs brings with it the danger of drug resistance evolution. A number of recent studies have shown that the emergence of drug-resistant influenza could undermine the usefulness of antiviral drugs for the control of an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. While these studies have provided important insights, the inherently stochastic nature of resistance generation and spread, as well as the potential for ongoing evolution of the resistant strain have not been fully addressed. Here, we study a stochastic model of drug resistance emergence and consecutive evolution of the resistant strain in response to antiviral control during an influenza pandemic. We find that taking into consideration the ongoing evolution of the resistant strain does not increase the probability of resistance emergence; however, it increases the total number of infecteds if a resistant outbreak occurs. Our study further shows that taking stochasticity into account leads to results that can differ from deterministic models. Specifically, we find that rapid and strong control cannot only contain a drug sensitive outbreak, it can also prevent a resistant outbreak from occurring. We find that the best control strategy is early intervention heavily based on prophylaxis at a level that leads to outbreak containment.

  abstract = {For many bacterial infections, drug resistant mutants are likely present by the time antibiotic treatment starts. Nevertheless, such infections are often successfully cleared. It is commonly assumed that this is due to the combined action of drug and immune response, the latter facilitating clearance of the resistant population. However, most studies of drug resistance emergence during antibiotic treatment focus almost exclusively on the dynamics of bacteria and the drug and neglect the contribution of immune defenses. Here, we develop and analyze several mathematical models that explicitly include an immune response. We consider different types of immune responses and investigate how each impacts the emergence of resistance. We show that an immune response that retains its strength despite a strong drug-induced decline of bacteria numbers considerably reduces the emergence of resistance, narrows the mutant selection window, and mitigates the effects of non-adherence to treatment. Additionally, we show that compared to an immune response that kills bacteria at a constant rate, one that trades reduced killing at high bacterial load for increased killing at low bacterial load is sometimes preferable. We discuss the predictions and hypotheses derived from this study and how they can be tested experimentally.},

  abstract = {Successful replication within an infected host and successful transmission between hosts are key to the continued spread of most pathogens. Competing selection pressures exerted at these different scales can lead to evolutionary trade-offs between the determinants of fitness within and between hosts. Here, we examine such a trade-off in the context of influenza A viruses and the differential pressures exerted by temperature-dependent virus persistence. For a panel of avian influenza A virus strains, we find evidence for a trade-off between the persistence at high versus low temperatures. Combining a within-host model of influenza infection dynamics with a between-host transmission model, we study how such a trade-off affects virus fitness on the host population level. We show that conclusions regarding overall fitness are affected by the type of link assumed between the within- and between-host levels and the main route of transmission (direct or environmental). The relative importance of virulence and immune response mediated virus clearance are also found to influence the fitness impacts of virus persistence at low versus high temperatures. Based on our results, we predict that if transmission occurs mainly directly and scales linearly with virus load, and virulence or immune responses are negligible, the evolutionary pressure for influenza viruses to evolve toward good persistence at high within-host temperatures dominates. For all other scenarios, influenza viruses with good environmental persistence at low temperatures seem to be favored.},

  abstract = {Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.},

One advantage of the proposed method is that for some ODE systems, one can obtain closed form conditional posterior distributions for all variables which substantially reduce the computational cost and facilitate the convergence process. An efficient Riemann manifold based hybrid Monte Carlo scheme is implemented to generate samples for variables whose conditional posterior distribution cannot be written in terms of closed form. Our approach can be applied to situations where the state variables are only partially observed.

The gammacoronaviruses primarily infect avian hosts. Within this genus of coronaviruses, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a highly infectious upper-respiratory tract disease in commercial poultry. IBV shows rapid evolution in chickens, frequently producing new antigenic types, which adds to the multiple serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect. Rapid evolution in IBV is facilitated by strong selection, large population sizes and high genetic diversity within hosts, and transmission bottlenecks between hosts. Genetic diversity within a host arises primarily by mutation, which includes substitutions, insertions and deletions. Mutations are caused both by the high error rate, and limited proof reading capability, of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, and by recombination. Recombination also generates new haplotype diversity by recombining existing variants. Rapid evolution of avian coronavirus IBV makes this virus extremely difficult to diagnose and control, but also makes it an excellent model system to study viral genetic diversity and the mechanisms behind the emergence of coronaviruses in their natural host.},

These in turn determine clinically relevant outcomes, such as morbidity and mortality. Despite the general recognition that inoculum dose is an important component of infection outcomes, we currently do not understand its impact in much detail. This study is intended to start filling this knowledge gap by analyzing inoculum dependent patterns of viral load dynamics in acute infections. Using experimental data for adenovirus and infectious bronchitis virus infections as examples, we demonstrate inoculum dose dependent patterns of virus dynamics. We analyze the data with the help of mathematical models to investigate what mechanisms can reproduce the patterns observed in experimental data. We find that models including components of both the innate and adaptive immune response are needed to reproduce the patterns found in the data. We further analyze which types of innate or adaptive immune response models agree with observed data. One interesting finding is that only models for the adaptive immune response that contain growth terms partially independent of viral load can properly reproduce observed patterns. This agrees with the idea that an antigen-independent, programmed response is part of the adaptive response. Our analysis provides useful insights into the types of model structures that are required to properly reproduce observed virus dynamics for varying inoculum doses. We suggest that such models should be taken as basis for future models of acute viral infections.},

Methods.\hspace{1em} We obtained demographic, clinical, and laboratory information on all A/H7N9 patients in Zhejiang province from China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention electronic databases.

  abstract = {Directly observed therapy (DOT) is almost universally used for the treatment of TB. Several meta-analyses using different methods have assessed the effectiveness of DOT compared to self-administered therapy (SAT). The results of these meta-analyses often conflict with some concluding DOT is superior and others that there is little or no difference. Meta-analyses can guide policymaking, but such analyses must be reliable. To assess the validity of a previous meta-analysis, we tried to reproduce it. We encountered problems with the previous analysis that did not allow for a meaningful reproduction. We describe the issues we encountered here. We then performed a new meta-analysis comparing the treatment outcomes of adults given treatment with SAT versus DOT. Outcomes in the new analysis are loss to follow-up, treatment failure, cure, treatment completed, and all-cause mortality. All data, documentation, and code used to generate our results is provided. Our new analysis included four randomized and three observational studies with 1603 and 1626 individuals respectively. The pooled relative risks (RR) are as follows: Lost to follow-up (RR = 1.2, 95\% CI 0.9, 1.7), Treatment Failure (RR = 1.1, 95\% CI 0.6, 2), Cure (RR = 0.9, 95\% CI 0.8, 1.1), Treatment Completion (RR = 1, 95\% CI 0.9, 1.1), Mortality (RR = 0.9, 95\% CI 0.6, 1.3). Based on data from our new meta-analysis, the magnitude of the difference between DOT and SAT for all reported outcomes is small, and none of the differences are statistically significant.},

  abstract = {Communicable diseases are often virulent, i.e. they cause morbidity symptoms in those infected. While some symptoms may be transmission-enhancing, other symptoms are likely to reduce transmission potential. For human diseases, the reduction in transmission opportunities is commonly caused by reduced activity. There is limited data regarding the potential impact of virulence on transmission potential. We performed an exploratory data analysis of 324 influenza patients at a university health centre during the 2016/2017 influenza season. We classified symptoms as infectiousness-related or morbidity-related and calculated two scores. The scores were used to explore the relationship between infectiousness, morbidity (virulence), and activity level. We found a decrease in the activity level with increasing morbidity scores. There was no consistent pattern between an activity level and an infectiousness score. We also found a positive correlation between morbidity and infectiousness scores. Overall, we find that increasing virulence leads to increased infectiousness and reduced activity, suggesting a trade-off that can impact overall transmission potential. Our findings indicate that a reduction of systemic symptoms may increase host activity without reducing infectiousness. Therefore, interventions should target both systemic- and infectiousness-related symptoms to reduce overall transmission potential. Our findings can also inform simulation models that investigate the impact of different interventions on transmission.},

Both mechanisms can explain the basic dynamics of an acute infection\textemdash exponential growth of the pathogen followed by control and clearance\textemdash and can also be represented by many different differential equation models. Consequently, traditional model comparison techniques using time series data can be ambiguous or inconclusive. We propose that varying the inoculum dose and measuring the subsequent infectious load can rule out target cell depletion by the pathogen as the main control mechanism. Infectious load can be any measure that is proportional to the number of infected cells, such as viraemia. We show that a twofold or greater change in infectious load is unlikely when target cell depletion controls infection, regardless of the model details. Analyzing previously published data from mice infected with influenza, we find the proportion of lung epithelial cells infected was 21-fold greater (95\% confidence interval 14\textendash 32) in the highest dose group than in the lowest. This provides evidence in favor of an alternative to target cell depletion, such as innate immunity, in controlling influenza infections in this experimental system. Data from other experimental animal models of acute primary infection have a similar pattern.},

Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we test this widely held conjecture using both simulations and experiments with small and large bacterial populations evolving in either a simple or a complex nutrient environment. Consistent with expectations, we find that small populations are adaptively constrained in the simple environment; however, in the complex environment small populations not only follow more heterogeneous adaptive trajectories, but can also attain higher fitness than the large populations. Large populations are constrained to near deterministic fixation of rare large-benefit mutations. While such determinism speeds adaptation on the smooth adaptive landscape represented by the simple environment, it can limit the ability of large populations from effectively exploring the underlying topography of rugged adaptive landscapes characterized by complex environments.
Conclusions: Our results show that adaptive constraints often faced by small populations can be circumvented during evolution on rugged adaptive landscapes.},

  abstract = {Background: Delay in tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis adversely affects patients' outcomes and prolongs transmission in the community. The influence of social contacts on steps taken by active pulmonary TB patients to seek a diagnosis has not been well examined.
Methods: A retrospective study design was use to enroll TB patients on treatment for 3 months or less and aged {$\geq$}18 years from 3 public clinics in Kampala, Uganda, from March to July 2014. Social network analysis was used to collect information about social contacts and health providers visited by patients to measure the number of steps and time between onset of symptoms and final diagnosis of TB.
Results: Of 294 TB patients, 58 \% were male and median age was 30 (IQR: 24\textendash 38) years. The median number of steps was 4 (IQR: 3, 7) corresponding to 70 (IQR: 28,140) days to diagnosis. New patients had more steps and time to diagnosis compared retreatment patients (5 vs. 3, P {$<$} 0.0001; 84 vs. 46 days P {$<$} 0.0001). Fifty-eight percent of patients first contacted persons in their social network. The first step to initiate seeking care accounted for 41 \% of the patients' time to diagnosis while visits to non-TB providers and TB providers (without a TB diagnosis) accounted for 34 \% and 11 \% respectively. New TB patients vs. retreatment (HR: 0.66, 95 \% CI; 1.11, 1.99), those who first contacted a non-TB health provider vs. contacting social network (HR: 0.72 95 \% CI; 0.55, 0.95) and HIV seronegative vs. seropositive patients (HR: 0.70, 95 \% CI; 0.53, 0.92) had a significantly lower likelihood of a timely final diagnosis.
Conclusions: There were four degrees of separation between the onset of symptoms in a TB patient and a final diagnosis. Both social and provider networks of patients influenced the diagnostic pathways. Most delays occurred in the first step which represents decisions to seek help, and through interactions with non-TB health providers. TB control programs should strengthen education and active screening in the community and in health care settings to ensure timely diagnosis of TB.},

  abstract = {Background: Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis and foodborne diarrheal disease in the United States. Norovirus vaccine development has progressed in recent years, but critical questions remain regarding which age groups should be vaccinated to maximize population impact.
Methods: We developed a deterministic, age-structured compartmental model of norovirus transmission and immunity in the U.S. population. The model was fit to age-specific monthly U.S. hospitalizations between 1996 and 2007. We simulated mass immunization of both pediatric and elderly populations assuming realistic coverages of 90\% and 65\%, respectively. We considered two mechanism of vaccine action, resulting in lower vaccine efficacy (lVE) between 22\% and 43\% and higher VE (hVE) of 50\%.
Results: Pediatric vaccination was predicted to avert 33\% (95\% CI: 27\%, 40\%) and 60\% (95\% CI: 49\%, 71\%) of norovirus episodes among children under five years for lVE and hVE, respectively. Vaccinating the elderly averted 17\% (95\% CI: 12\%, 20\%) and 38\% (95\% CI: 34\%, 42\%) of cases in 65+ year olds for lVE and hVE, respectively. At a population level, pediatric vaccination was predicted to avert 18\textendash 21 times more cases and twice as many deaths per vaccinee compared to elderly vaccination.
Conclusions: The potential benefits are likely greater for a pediatric program, both via direct protection of vaccinated children and indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals, including adults and the elderly. These findings argue for a clinical development plan that will deliver a vaccine with a safety and efficacy profile suitable for use in children.},

The application of these methods, however, is restricted due to various assumptions required by these models. When the number of observations per subject is sufficiently large, and individual trajectories are noisy, functional data analysis (FDA) methods serve as an alternative to parametric longitudinal data analysis techniques. However, the use of FDA in RCTs is rare. In this paper, the effectiveness of FDA and linear mixed models (LMMs) was compared by analyzing data from rural persons living with HIV and comorbid depression enrolled in a depression treatment randomized clinical trial. Interactive voice response systems were used for weekly administrations of the 10item Self-Administered Depression Scale (SADS) over 41 weeks. Functional principal component analysis and functional regression analysis methods detected a statistically significant difference in SADS between telphone-administered interpersonal psychotherapy (tele-IPT) and controls but linear mixed effects model results did not. Additional simulation studies were conducted to compare FDA and LMMs under a different nonlinear trajectory assumption. In this clinical trial with sufficient per subject measured outcomes and individual trajectories that are noisy and nonlinear, we found FDA methods to be a better alternative to LMMs.},

  abstract = {The HIV-1 epidemic is a remarkable public health concern in China, especially in developed trade areas. We aimed to investigate the interaction of migration with the local transmission network in a typical trade area, Yiwu City, the world's largest commodity distribution center. Based on 390 pol sequences from 413 participants diagnosed between 2014 and 2016, putative transmission clusters and the underlying demographic and behavioral characteristics were analyzed. Recent infection status was determined by HIV-1 limiting antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay to identify active clusters. Multiple subtypes were identified, with a predominance of CRF01\_AE (47.4\%) and CRF07\_BC (40.8\%), followed by 9 other subtypes and 8 URFs. Multivariable analyses revealed that individuals in clusters were more likely to be local residents, infected through heterosexual behaviors, and infected with CRF01\_AE (P~{$<~$}.05). Of men who have sex with men (MSM), 81\% were linked to other MSM, and only 3\% were linked to heterosexual women. Of heterosexual women, 67\% were linked to heterosexual men, and 11\% to MSM. Yiwu residents were more likely to link to locals than that of migrants (43\% vs 20\%, P~{$<~$}.001). By contrast, local MSM and migrant MSM all had high percentages of linkage to migrant MSM (57\% vs 69\%, P~=~.069). Our findings reveal that migration promotes the dissemination and dynamic change of HIV, which are interwoven between locals and migrants. The results highlight the far-reaching influence of migrant MSM on the local HIV transmission network.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease with a peculiar feature: Upon infection with the causative agent, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB), most hosts enter a latent state during which no transmission of MTB to new hosts occurs. Only a fraction of latently infected hosts develop TB disease and can potentially infect new hosts. At first glance, this seems like a waste of transmission potential and therefore an evolutionary suboptimal strategy for MTB. It might be that the human immune response keeps MTB in check in most hosts, thereby preventing it from achieving its evolutionary optimum. Another possible explanation is that long latency and progression to disease in only a fraction of hosts are evolutionary beneficial to MTB by allowing it to persist better in small host populations. Given that MTB has co-evolved with human hosts for millenia or longer, it likely encountered small host populations for a large share of its evolutionary history and had to evolve strategies of persistence. Here, we use a mathematical model to show that indeed, MTB persistence is optimal for an intermediate duration of latency and level of activation. The predicted optimal level of activation is above the observed value, suggesting that human co-evolution has lead to host immunity, which keeps MTB below its evolutionary optimum.},
