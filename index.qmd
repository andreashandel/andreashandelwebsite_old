I am a Professor in the [Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://publichealth.uga.edu/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics/), [College of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.uga.edu/), at the [University of Georgia (UGA)](https://www.uga.edu/).

My research and teaching focus on data analysis and modeling of infectious diseases.

This website contains [a short bio](about.qmd) and products such as [blog posts](/posts/), [presentations](/presentations/), and [various tools and resources related to teaching and research](/projects/).

More research related details can be found [on my research group site](https://handelgroup.uga.edu/). Some overlap between the two sites might occur.

I send out a monthly (or less frequent) newsletter with updates and musings on my various projects. If interested, [you can subscribe here.](subscribe.html)
