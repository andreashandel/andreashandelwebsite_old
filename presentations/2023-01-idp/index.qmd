These are slides for a talk/discussion I led with our graduate students discussing Individual Development Plans, and specifically the AAAS myIDP plan. This is the kick-off presentation/discussion for a semester-long IDP development project done as part of the seminar class. <a href="2023_01_IDP_Introduction.html" target="_blank">The presentation slides are here.</a>

This is a slightly updated version of a similar presentation from a few years ago.
