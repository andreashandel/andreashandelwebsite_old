These are slides for a talk discussing a recent project that investigated the impact of standard-dose versus high-dose Influenza vaccine on immune responses. I gave the talk during the ISV Virtual Congress North America Influenza Vaccine Symposium. <a href="2020_12_ISV.html" target="_blank">The presentation slides are here.</a>

The organizers also recorded the event, the video recording [can be found here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_Lx6Q9jT0o)
