These are slides for a talk I gave to a group of undergraduate students as part of a First Year Odyssey Seminar class. I provided a very brief introduction to infectious disease modeling, then we explored the [DSAIDE software](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIDE/). <a href="2021-10-fyos.html" target="_blank">The presentation slides are here.</a>
