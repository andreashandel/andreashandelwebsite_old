title: "My monthly (or less frequent) newsletter"

A while ago, I posted a link to a blog entry I had just written to LinkedIn (I forgot which one). Someone asked if I had some kind of subscription option so they could stay informed about new blog posts from me. At that time, I didn't have any such option. A few months later, I decided to set up something along those lines, a very simple newsletter. (Inspired by [Robert Talbert](http://rtalbert.org) and his monthly newsletter - though mine is much more basic.)

I send a newsletter at most once a month, on the first Monday of the month (or around that time üòÅ). If there are months where I didn't create anything worth sharing, there is no newsletter. So if you subscribe to this newsletter, you'll receive 12 or less emails from me per year.

The newsletter currently consists of 3 - generally brief - sections. I describe things I created, i.e. new blog posts, presentations, and R package developments; I talk about things (generally books) I consumed that are possibly worth sharing; and at times I share some assorted thoughts on topics broadly related to my work.

So if you are interested in getting -- very infrequent -- emails from me announcing new creations, go ahead and subscribe by entering your email address here:

You might receive an email to confirm that you really want to subscribe. Don't forget to confirm (unless you changed your mind). And of course you can unsubscribe at any time.

It goes without saying (but I say it anyway üòÉ) that I won't use your email for any other purpose. I use [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) for this. I assume they know how to keep their servers safe so your email doesn't get leaked. (And if it did, would it matter? Aren't all our email addresses already on a million spam lists anyway? ü§∑ I've given up trying to fight it - fortunately most spam filters are pretty good these days.)
