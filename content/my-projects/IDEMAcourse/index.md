Infectious Disease Epidemiology - A model-based approach (IDEMA) is an online course I teach at the University of Georgia. 
All course materials (or links to the materials) are available in the form of a simple GitHub website and can be used by anyone. You can find the course [on this site](https://andreashandel.github.io/IDEMAcourse/).

The course also makes heavy use of my [IDEMA online book](https://andreashandel.github.io/IDEMAbook/) and the [DSAIDE R package](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIDE/).
