This - still in development - R package allows teachers to easily administer and auto-grade quizzes that students submit online. It replaces the functionality often found in learning management systems (LMS). Student submissions can be fully analyzed to gain insights into problem areas. Learn more about it [on the package website](https://andreashandel.github.io/quizgrader/).
