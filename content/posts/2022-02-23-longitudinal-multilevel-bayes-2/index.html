<p>This is part two of a tutorial illustrating how to perform a Bayesian analysis of longitudinal data using a multilevel/hierarchical/mixed-effects setup. In this part, we‚Äôll fit the simulated data using the <code>rethinking</code> package.</p>
<p>I assume you‚Äôve read <a href="/posts/longitudinal-multilevel-bayesian-analysis-1/">part 1</a>, otherwise this post won‚Äôt make much sense. You might even want to open that first part in a separate tab for quick comparison.</p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In the previous post, I showed a setup where some continuous outcome data (in our case, virus load) was collected over time for several individuals. Those individuals differed by some characteristic (in our case, dose at which they got infected). I specified several models that are useful for both fitting the data, and creating simulations. We‚Äôve done the simulating part, now we‚Äôll start fitting models to that data.</p>
<p>The advantage of fitting to simulated data is that we know exactly what model and what parameters produced the data, so we can compare our model estimates to the truth (i.e.¬†the parameter and model settings that were used to generate the data) to see how our models perform. It is always good to do that to get some confidence that your models make sense, before you apply them to real data. For the latter, you don‚Äôt know what the ‚Äútruth‚Äù is, so you have to trust whatever your model tells you.</p>
<p>Fitting Bayesian models can take a good bit of time (hours, depending on the settings for the fitting routine). It is generally advisable to place code that takes a while to run into its own <code>R</code> script, run that script and then save the results for further processing. This is in fact what I did here. I wrote 2 separate R scripts, one that does the fitting and one that does the exploration of the model fits. The code shown below comes from those 2 scripts. There is some value in re-coding yourself by copying and pasting the code chunks from this tutorial, but if you just want to get all the code from this post you can find it <a href="/posts/longitudinal-multilevel-bayesian-analysis-2/ulamfitmodels.R">here</a> and <a href="/posts/longitudinal-multilevel-bayesian-analysis-2/ulamexploremodels.R">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-setup" class="section level1">
<h1>R Setup</h1>
<p>We‚Äôll start with loading needed packages. Make sure these packages are installed. Since <code>rethinking</code> uses the <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan Bayesian modeling engine</a>, you need to install it too. It is in my experience mostly seamless, but at times it seems to be tricky. I generally follow the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking"><code>rethinking</code> website</a> and it has so far always worked for me. It might need some fiddling, but you should be able to get them all to work.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&#39;dplyr&#39;) # for data manipulation
library(&#39;ggplot2&#39;) # for plotting
library(&#39;cmdstanr&#39;) #for model fitting
library(&#39;rethinking&#39;) #for model fitting
library(&#39;fs&#39;) #for file path</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="data-loading" class="section level1">
<h1>Data loading</h1>
<p>We‚Äôll jump right in and load the data we generated in the previous tutorial.
In this example, I‚Äôm fitting the data that was generated by model 3 since it shows the most realistic pattern. You can try to fit to the other 2 datasets and see what you find (I‚Äôll show an example in <a href="https://www.andreashandel.com/posts/longitudinal-multilevel-bayesian-analysis-4/">this part of the tutorial</a>. It is not necessarily the case that the model that produced a certain dataset is also the one that fits it best.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>simdat &lt;- readRDS(&quot;simdat.Rds&quot;)
#using dataset 3 for fitting
#also removing anything in the dataframe that&#39;s not used for fitting
#makes the ulam/Stan code more robust
fitdat=list(id=simdat[[3]]$id,
            outcome = simdat[[3]]$outcome,
            dose_adj = simdat[[3]]$dose_adj,
            time = simdat[[3]]$time)
#pulling out number of observations
Ntot = length(unique(simdat$m3$id))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="fitting-with-rethinking" class="section level1">
<h1>Fitting with rethinking</h1>
<p>We‚Äôll start by fitting the different models we discussed in <a href="/posts/longitudinal-multilevel-bayesian-analysis-1/">part 1</a> using the <code>rethinking</code> package. The main function in that package, which does the fitting using <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>, is <code>ulam</code>.</p>
<p>First, we‚Äôll specify each model, then we‚Äôll run them all in a single loop.</p>
<div id="model-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Model 1</h2>
<p>These lines of code specify the full set of equations for our model 1. Note how closely the R code resembles the mathematical notation. That close match between math and code is one of the nice features of <code>rethinking</code>/<code>ulam</code>. Also note the indexing of the parameters <code>a0</code> and <code>b0</code> by <code>id</code>, which indicates that each individual has their own values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#wide-prior, no-pooling model
#separate intercept for each individual/id
#2x(N+1)+1 parameters
m1 &lt;- alist(
  # distribution of outcome
  outcome ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),

  # main equation for time-series trajectory
  mu &lt;- exp(alpha)*log(time) - exp(beta)*time,

  #equations for alpha and beta
  alpha &lt;-  a0[id] + a1*dose_adj,
  beta &lt;-  b0[id] + b1*dose_adj,

  #priors
  a0[id] ~ dnorm(2,  10),
  b0[id] ~ dnorm(0.5, 10),

  a1 ~ dnorm(0.3, 1),
  b1 ~ dnorm(-0.3, 1),
  sigma ~ cauchy(0,1)
)</code></pre>
<p>You might have noticed that I chose some of the values in the priors to be different than the values we used to generate the simulated data. I don‚Äôt want to make things too easy for the fitting routine üòÅ. We want to have the fitting routine ‚Äúfind‚Äù the right answer (parameter estimates). Hopefully, even if we don‚Äôt start at the right values, we‚Äôll end up there.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Model 2</h2>
<p>Now we‚Äôll set up model 2 exactly as for model 1 but with some of the priors changed as discussed previously. Specifically, the priors now force the individual-level parameters to be essentially all the same. Note that - as you will see below - this model is not a good model, and if one wanted to not allow the <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> parameters to have any individual level variation, one should just implement and run the model 2 alternative I describe below. We‚Äôll run this model anyway, to just illustration and to see what happens.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#narrow-prior, full-pooling model
#2x(N+2)+1 parameters
m2 &lt;- alist(
  outcome ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
  mu &lt;- exp(alpha)*log(time) - exp(beta)*time,
  alpha &lt;-  a0[id] + a1*dose_adj,
  beta &lt;-  b0[id] + b1*dose_adj,
  a0[id] ~ dnorm(mu_a,  0.0001),
  b0[id] ~ dnorm(mu_b, 0.0001),
  mu_a ~ dnorm(2, 1),
  mu_b ~ dnorm(0.5, 1),
  a1 ~ dnorm(0.3, 1),
  b1 ~ dnorm(-0.3, 1),
  sigma ~ cauchy(0,1)
)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="model-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Model 3</h2>
<p>This is the same as model 1 but with different values for the priors. These priors are somewhat regularizing and more reasonable. As we‚Äôll see, the results are similar to those from model 1, but the model runs more efficiently and thus faster.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#regularizing prior, partial-pooling model
m3 &lt;- alist(
  outcome ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
  mu &lt;- exp(alpha)*log(time) - exp(beta)*time,

  a0[id] ~ dnorm(2,  1),
  b0[id] ~ dnorm(0.5, 1),
  a1 ~ dnorm(0.3, 1),
  b1 ~ dnorm(-0.3, 1),
  sigma ~ cauchy(0,1)
)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="model-4" class="section level2">
<h2>Model 4</h2>
<p>This is our adaptive pooling model. For this model, we specify a few extra distributions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#adaptive priors, partial-pooling model
#2x(N+2)+1 parameters
m4 &lt;- alist(
  outcome ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
  mu &lt;- exp(alpha)*log(time) - exp(beta)*time,
  alpha &lt;-  a0[id] + a1*dose_adj,

  a0[id] ~ dnorm(mu_a,  sigma_a),
  b0[id] ~ dnorm(mu_b, sigma_b),
  mu_a ~ dnorm(2, 1),
  mu_b ~ dnorm(0.5, 1),
  sigma_a ~ cauchy(0, 1),
  sigma_b ~ cauchy(0, 1),
  a1 ~ dnorm(0.3, 1),
  b1 ~ dnorm(-0.3, 1),
  sigma ~ cauchy(0, 1)
)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="a-few-model-alternatives" class="section level2">
<h2>A few model alternatives</h2>
<p>There are a few model alternatives I also want to consider. The first one is a version of model 2 that gets rid of individual-level parameters and instead has only population-level parameters. I discussed this model in part 1 of the tutorial and called it 2a there. Here is the model definition</p>
<div id="model-2a" class="section level3">
<h3>Model 2a</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>#full-pooling model, population-level parameters only
#2+2+1 parameters
m2a &lt;- alist(
  outcome ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
  mu &lt;- exp(alpha)*log(time) - exp(beta)*time,
  alpha &lt;-  a0 + a1*dose_adj,
  beta &lt;-  b0 + b1*dose_adj,
  a0 ~ dnorm(2,  0.1),
  b0 ~ dnorm(0.5, 0.1),
  a1 ~ dnorm(0.3, 1),
  b1 ~ dnorm(-0.3, 1),
  sigma ~ cauchy(0,1)
)</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>a0</code> and <code>b0</code> are not indexed by <code>id</code> anymore and are now single numbers, instead of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> values as before.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-4a" class="section level3">
<h3>Model 4a</h3>
<p>Another model I want to look at is a variant of model 4. This is in fact the same model as model 4, but written in a different way. A potential problem with model 4 and similar models is that parameters inside parameters can lead to inefficient or unreliable numerical results when running your Monte Carlo routine (in our case, this is Stan-powered Hamilton Monte Carlo). It is possible to rewrite the model such that it is the same model, but it looks different in a way that makes the numerics often run better. It turns out for our example, model 4 above runs ok. But it‚Äôs a good idea to be aware of the fact that one can re-write models if needed, therefore I decided to include this model alternative here.</p>
<p>The above model 4 is called a <strong>centered</strong> model and the re-write for model 4a is called a <strong>non-centered</strong> model. The trick is to pull out the parameters from inside the distributions for <span class="math inline">\(a_{0,i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_{0,i}\)</span>. The non-centered model looks like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#adaptive priors, partial-pooling model
#non-centered
m4a &lt;- alist(
  outcome ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
  mu &lt;- exp(alpha)*log(time) - exp(beta)*time,
  #rewritten to non-centered
  alpha &lt;-  mu_a + az[id]*sigma_a + a1*dose_adj,
  beta  &lt;-  mu_b + bz[id]*sigma_b + b1*dose_adj,
  #rewritten to non-centered
  az[id] ~ dnorm(0, 1),
  bz[id] ~ dnorm(0, 1),
  mu_a ~ dnorm(2, 1),
  mu_b ~ dnorm(0.5, 1),
  sigma_a ~ cauchy(0, 1),
  sigma_b ~ cauchy(0, 1),
  a1 ~ dnorm(0.3, 1),
  b1 ~ dnorm(-0.3, 1),
  sigma ~ cauchy(0, 1)

  )</code></pre>
<p>Again, this model is mathematically the same as the original model 4. If this is confusing and doesn‚Äôt make sense (it sure wouldn‚Äôt to me if I just saw that for the first time üòÅ), check the <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">Statistical Rethinking book</a>. (And no, I do not get a commission for continuing to point you to the book, and I wish there was a free online version (or a cheap paperback). But it is a great book and if you want to learn this kind of modeling for real, I think it‚Äôs worth the investment.)</p>
</div>
<div id="model-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Model 5</h3>
<p>Another model, which I‚Äôm calling model 5 here, is one that does not include the dose effect. That means, parameters <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> are gone. Otherwise I‚Äôm following the setup of model 1. The reason I‚Äôm doing this is because on initial fitting of the above models, I could not obtain estimates for the dose parameters I used for the simulation. I noticed strong correlations between posterior distributions of the model parameters. I suspected an issue with non-identifiable parameters (i.e, trying to estimate more parameters than the data supports). To figure out what was going on, I wanted to see how a model without the dose component would perform. It turned out that the main reason things didn‚Äôt look right was because I had a typo in the code that generated the data, so what I thought was the generating model actually wasn‚Äôt ü§¶. A helpful colleague and reader pointed this out. Once I fixed it, things made more sense. But I figured it‚Äôs instructive to keep this model anyway.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#no dose effect
#separate intercept for each individual/id
#2xN+1 parameters
m5 &lt;- alist(
  # distribution of outcome
  outcome ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),

  # main equation for time-series trajectory
  mu &lt;- exp(alpha)*log(time) - exp(beta)*time,

  #equations for alpha and beta
  alpha &lt;-  a0[id],
  beta &lt;-  b0[id],

  #priors
  a0[id] ~ dnorm(2,  10),
  b0[id] ~ dnorm(0.5, 10),

  sigma ~ cauchy(0,1)
)</code></pre>

<div id="setting-starting-values" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting starting values</h2>
<p>Any fitting routine needs to start with some parameter values and then from there tries to improve. <code>Stan</code> uses a heuristic way of picking some starting values. Often that works, sometimes it fails initially but then the routine fixes itself, and sometimes it fails all the way. In either case, I find it a good idea to specify starting values, even if they are not strictly needed. And it‚Äôs good to know that this is possible and how to do it, just in case you need it at some point. Setting starting values gives you more control, and you also know exactly what should happen when you look at for instance the traceplots of the chains.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## Setting starting values
#starting values for model 1
startm1 = list(a0 = rep(2,Ntot), b0 = rep(0.5,Ntot), a1 = 0.3 , b1 = -0.3, sigma = 1)
#starting values for model 2
startm2 = list(a0 = rep(2,Ntot), b0 = rep(0.5,Ntot), mu_a = 2, mu_b = 1, a1 = 0.3 , b1 = -0.3, sigma = 1)
#starting values for model 3
startm3 = startm1
#starting values for models 4 and 4a
startm4 = list(mu_a = 2, sigma_a = 1, mu_b = 1, sigma_b = 1, a1 = 0.3 , b1 = -0.3, sigma = 1)
startm4a = startm4
#starting values for model 2a
startm2a = list(a0 = 2, b0 = 0.5, a1 = 0.3, b1 = -0.3, sigma = 1)
#starting values for model 5
startm5 = list(a0 = rep(2,Ntot), b0 = rep(0.5,Ntot), sigma = 1)

#put different starting values in list
#need to be in same order as models below
startlist = list(startm1,startm2,startm3,startm4,startm2a,startm4,startm5)</code></pre>
<p>Note that we only specify values for the parameters that are directly estimated. Parameters that are built from other parameters (e.g.¬†<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>) are computed and don‚Äôt need starting values.</p>
<p>For some more detailed discussion on starting values, see for instance <a href="https://solomonkurz.netlify.app/post/2021-06-05-don-t-forget-your-inits/">this post by Solomon Kurz</a>. He uses <code>brms</code> in his example, but the same idea applies with any package/fitting routine. He also explains that it is a good idea to set different starting values for each chain. I am not sure if/how this could be done with <code>rethinking</code>, it seems <code>ulam</code> does not support this? But it can be done for <code>brms</code> (and I‚Äôm doing it there).</p>
</div>
<div id="model-fitting" class="section level2">
<h2>Model fitting</h2>
<p>Now that we specified all models, we can loop through all models and fit them.
First, some setup before the actual fitting loop.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#general settings for fitting
#you might want to adjust based on your computer
warmup = 4000
iter = warmup + floor(warmup/2)
max_td = 18 #tree depth
adapt_delta = 0.9999
chains = 5
cores  = chains
seed = 1234

#stick all models into a list
modellist = list(m1=m1,m2=m2,m3=m3,m4=m4,m2a=m2a,m4a=m4a,m5=m5)
# set up a list in which we&#39;ll store our results
fl = vector(mode = &quot;list&quot;, length = length(modellist))


#setting for parameter constraints
constraints = list(sigma=&quot;lower=0&quot;,sigma_a=&quot;lower=0&quot;,sigma_b=&quot;lower=0&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The first code block defines various settings for the <code>ulam</code> function. Look at the help file for details. Then we place all models into a list, set up an empty list for our fit results, and specify the data needed for fitting. The final command enforces some constraints on parameters. For our model, we want Half-Cauchy distributions for all variance parameters to ensure they are positive. Above, I specified them as Cauchy. There is no direct Half-Cauchy implementation. The way one achieves one is to tell <code>ulam</code>/<code>Stan</code> that the values for those parameters need to be positive. That‚Äôs what the <code>constraints</code> line in the code below does.</p>
<p>Looping over each model and fitting it. In addition to the actual fitting call to <code>ulam</code>, I‚Äôm also printing a few messages and storing the model name and the time it took to run. That‚Äôs useful for diagnostic. It‚Äôs generally a good idea to do short runs/chains until things work, then do a large run to get the actual result. Recording the running time helps decide how long a real run can be and how long it might take.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to explore the model fitting results. All fits are in the list called <code>fl</code>.

Note that the code chunks below come from <a href="/posts/longitudinal-multilevel-bayesian-analysis-2/ulamexploremodels.R">this second R script</a>, thus some things are repeated (e.g., loading of simulated data).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># loading list of previously saved fits.

<p>You should explore your model fits carefully. Look at the trace-plots or trank-plots with the <code>traceplot()</code> and <code>trankplot()</code> functions in <code>rethinking</code>. Make sure the chains are looking ok. You can also use the <code>summary</code> function to get some useful information on our model. To go further, you can call <code>stancode()</code> to get the actual Stan code for the model. This can be helpful to both learn Stan, and to check if the model translates into Stan code the way you expected it to.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm showing a few of those explorations to illustrate what I mean. For any real fitting, it is important to carefully look at all the output and make sure everything worked as expected and makes sense.</p>
<p>To keep output manageable, I‚Äôm using model 2a here, which has no individual-level parameters, thus only a total of 5.</p>

One interesting feature is the strong correlation between the parameters <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> and also <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>. Recall that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> determined the initial increase of the function, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> the eventual decline. Both parameters determine the shape of the deterministic trajectory for all times, so large values for both can lead to somewhat similar results as small values for both. That is the reason for the correlations we see (and this is a different effect from the correlations we‚Äôll discuss below).</p>
<div id="models-1-and-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Models 1 and 3</h2>
<p>Now I‚Äôll look at bit more carefully at the different models. We start by comparing fits for models 1 and 3. Those two are essentially the same model, with the only difference being wider priors for the individual-level parameters in model 1. It is worth mentioning that when running the fitting routine, model 1 takes much longer to fit than model 3. With the settings I used, runtimes were 227 versus 39 minutes. The wide priors made the fitting efficiency poor. But let‚Äôs see how it impacts the results.</p>
<p>First, we explore priors and posteriors. They are easy to extract from the models using the <code>extract.prior()</code> and <code>extract.samples()</code> functions from <code>rethinking</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#get priors and posteriors for models 1 and 3
m1prior &lt;- extract.prior(fl[[1]]$fit, n = 1e4)
m1post &lt;- extract.samples(fl[[1]]$fit, n = 1e4)

m3prior &lt;- extract.prior(fl[[3]]$fit, n = 1e4)
m3post &lt;- extract.samples(fl[[3]]$fit, n = 1e4)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can plot the distributions. Note that for the individual-level parameters <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span>, the plots show the distribution across all individuals. The dashed lines show the priors, the solid the posteriors. Black is model 1, blue is model 3.</p>

<p>We set up the models to have wider <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> priors for model 1, and the same priors for the <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> parameters. The dashed lines in the figures show that. Looking at the posteriors, we find that changing the priors has an impact, especially for <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>. Not only does model 3 lead to more peaked posteriors, they are also not centered at the same values, especially for <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good sign. We want the data to dominate the results, the priors should just be there to ensure the models explore the right parameter space efficiently and don‚Äôt do anything crazy. The fact that the same model, started with different priors, leads to different posterior distributions is in my opinion concerning. It could be that with more sampling, the posteriors might get closer. Or it might suggest that we are overfitting and have non-identifiability problems here.</p>
<p>One way to check that further is to look at potential correlations between parameter posterior distributions, e.g., using a <code>pairs()</code> plot as shown above.
Here are such plots for the parameters associated with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> for model 1. I only plot a few for each dose, otherwise the plots won‚Äôt be legible inside this html document.
But you can try for yourself, if you make the plot large enough you can fit them all. You can also make plots for model 3 and for the <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> parameters, those look very similar.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># all &quot;a&quot; parameters - too big to show
#pairs(fl[[1]]$fit, pars = c(&quot;a0&quot;,&quot;a1&quot;))
# a few parameters for each dose

<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/mod_1_3_pair_plots-3.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Recall that we set up the model such that dose is non-zero for low and high dose, while for the intermediate dose it drops out of the model. What seems to happen is that if the dose effect, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span>, is present, there is a strong correlation among that parameter and the individual-level parameters for that dose. That part makes some sense to me. Both <span class="math inline">\(a_{0,i}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> can change <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and thus the trajectory. If one is low, the other might be high, and the reverse, leading to similarly good fits.</p>
<p>Because every <span class="math inline">\(a_{0,i}\)</span> is correlated with <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> in this way, this also leads to correlations among the <span class="math inline">\(a_{0,i}\)</span> values. I am surprised that this is an essentially perfect correlation. Maybe, if I thought about it harder and/or did the math, it would be clear that it needs to be that way. But I haven‚Äôt yet, so for now I‚Äôm just taking it as given üòÅ. Overall, this is another sign of that we might be overfitting and have non-identifiability problems, i.e.¬†combinations for different values of <span class="math inline">\(a_{0,i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> can lead to more or less the same results (everything I write here of course also holds for the <span class="math inline">\(b_{0,i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> parameters).</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs move on and now look at the posterior distributions in numerical form. For that, I use the <code>precis</code> function from <code>rethinking</code>.
Instead of printing all the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> different values of <span class="math inline">\(a_{0,i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_{0,i}\)</span>, I compute their means. If you want to see them all, change to <code>depth=2</code> in the <code>precis</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Model 1

<p>The models seem to have converged ok, based on <code>Rhat</code> values of 1. Some parameters sampled better than others, as can be seen by the varying <code>n_eff</code> values. I used 5 chains of 2000 post-warmup samples for each chain, so the actual samples are 10000. If <code>n_eff</code> is lower than that, it means the sampling was not efficient, more means it worked very well (see e.g.¬†Statistical Rethinking why it‚Äôs possible to get more effective samples than actual samples.)</p>
<p>We find that estimates for <span class="math inline">\(a_{0}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> are similar, <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> differ more.</p>
<p>Again, note that the only thing we changed between models 1 and 3 are to make the priors for the <span class="math inline">\(a_{0,i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_{0,i}\)</span> parameters tighter. It didn‚Äôt seem to impact estimates for those parameters, but it did impact the estimates for the posterior distributions of parameters <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>. The numbers are consistent with the posterior distribution figures above.</p>

<div id="comparing-model-estimates-with-the-truth" class="section level2">
<h2>Comparing model estimates with the truth</h2>
<p>We know the ‚Äútruth‚Äù here, i.e., the actual values of the parameters which we used to created the simulated data. To generate the data, we used these parameter values: <span class="math inline">\(\sigma =\)</span> 1, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_a =\)</span> 3, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_b =\)</span> 1, <span class="math inline">\(a_1 =\)</span> 0.1, <span class="math inline">\(b_1 =\)</span> -0.1. We also said that our main scientific question is if there is a dose effect, i.e.¬†non-zero <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>The models find estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> that are close to what we used. The estimates for <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> are not that great. That‚Äôs especially true for model 1. With these models, we aren‚Äôt able to convincingly recover the parameters used to generate the data. I‚Äôm not sure if increasing the sampling (longer or more chains) would help. Both models, especially model 1, already took quite a while to run. Thus I‚Äôm not too keen to try it with even more samples. As we‚Äôll see below, alternative models do better.</p>

<p>The first thing to note is that model 2 performs awfully, with <code>Rhat</code> values &gt;1 and very low effective sample size <code>n_eff</code>. This indicates that this model doesn‚Äôt work well for the data. Whenever you see diagnostics like that, you should not take the estimated values seriously. However, let‚Äôs pretend for a moment that we can take them seriously. Here is what we find.</p>
<p>First, both models produce similar estimates. Since model 2a is simpler and doesn‚Äôt have that strange feature of us enforcing a very tight distribution for the <span class="math inline">\(a_{0,i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_{0,i}\)</span> parameters, it actually samples much better, see the higher <code>n_eff</code> numbers. It also runs much faster, 0.9 minutes compared to 28 minutes for model 2.</p>
<p>Both models do a very poor job estimating <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. That‚Äôs because we don‚Äôt allow the models to have the flexibility needed to fit the data, so it has to account for any variation between its estimated mean trajectory and the real data by making <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> large.</p>
<p>Since the models are more constrained compared to models 1 and 3, they produce estimates for <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> that are tighter. However, these estimates are over-confident. overall these models underfitting and are not good. We can for instance look at this using the <code>compare</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>compare(fl[[1]]$fit,fl[[3]]$fit,fl[[2]]$fit,fl[[5]]$fit)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##                  WAIC       SE        dWAIC        dSE    pWAIC        weight

<p>I‚Äôm not going to discuss things in detail (see <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">Statistical Rethinking</a>), but a lower WAIC means a model that fits best in the sense that it strikes a good balance between fitting the data while not overfitting. As you can see, models 1 and 3 perform very similarly and models 2 and 2a are much worse.</p>
<p>The larger WAIC indicates either strong overfitting or underfitting. In this case, it‚Äôs underfitting. The models are not flexible enough to capture the individual-level variation. You‚Äôll see that clearly in the plots shown further below. If we did indeed not want to account for individual-level variation, we should go with a model that simply doesn‚Äôt include it, i.e.¬†model 2a. The contrived model 2 with very narrow priors is just a bad model, and I‚Äôm really only exploring it here for demonstration purposes.</p>
</div>
<div id="models-4-and-4a" class="section level2">
<h2>Models 4 and 4a</h2>
<p>Now we get to the models we really care about. When I set up the models, I suggested that model 4 was similar to models 1-3, but with priors adaptively chosen. That didn‚Äôt apply during data generation/simulation since in that step, we always need to manually choose values. But during the fitting/estimation, we should expect that model 4 chooses priors in a smart way, such that it is better than the models where we fixed the priors. Let‚Äôs see what model 4 produces. We also look at model 4a, which is exactly the same model, just rewritten to potentially make the numerical fitting routine more efficient.</p>

<p>As you can see, up to numerical sampling variability, the results for models 4 and 4a are pretty much the same. That should be expected, since they are the same model, just reformulated for potential efficiency. Also, the posterior distributions are much narrower than the priors.

<p>We still see the same issue with correlations among the parameters for dose levels where <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> is acting, though the correlations are not as extreme. They are also minor between the overall estimates for the mean of the <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> parameters and <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>. I interpret this to mean that the adaptive sampling helped somewhat with the identifiability and overfitting problem, though it seems to not fully resolve it. The fact that we gave each individual their own <span class="math inline">\(a_{0,i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_{0,i}\)</span> values allows those parameters to still ‚Äúabsorb‚Äù some of the dose-dependent signal in <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>.</p>

<p>The numerics confirm that the two models lead to essentially the same results. The values for <code>n_eff</code> differ between models, though neither model is consistently larger. This suggests that each model formulation had advantages in sampling for some of the parameters.</p>
<p>In terms of run times, there wasn‚Äôt much difference, with 5 minutes for model 4 versus 7 minutes for model 4a (much better than models 1-3).</p>
<p>If we compare the parameter estimates with the true values and those found for models 1 and 3 above, we find that again the true <span class="math inline">\(\mu_a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> are estimated fairly well. Estimates for <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> are now also pretty good, and the credible intervals are less wide.</p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs briefly run the <code>compare</code> function too and include model 3 as well. In addition to using WAIC for comparison, I‚Äôm also including PSIS. Read about it in the Statistical Rethinking book. One advantage of PSIS is that it gives warnings if the estimates might not be reliable. You see that this happens here.</p>

<p>We do find that model 4/4a performs a bit better, but not by much. Note that model 4/4a has more actual parameters, but the effective parameters (which is described by <code>pWAIC</code>) is smaller. Though the difference is small and WAIC and PSIS don‚Äôt fully agree.</p>
<p>Overall, this suggests that the adaptive pooling approach helped to estimate results more precisely and efficiently and is the best of the models.</p>

<div id="computing-predictions" class="section level1">
<h1>Computing predictions</h1>
<p>Looking at parameters as we did so far is useful. But we also want to see how model predictions look. It is possible to have a model that predicts overall well, even if the parameter estimates are not right (of course, for real, non-simulated data, we generally don‚Äôt know what the ‚Äúright‚Äù values are). The opposite can‚Äôt happen, if you have the right model and the parameter estimates are right, the predictions will be good. But again, you never know if you have the right model, i.e., the model that captures the process underlying the data. For any real data, you almost certainly do not. Thus you could get parameters that look ‚Äúright‚Äù (e.g.¬†narrow credible intervals) but the model is still not good. Our models 2 and 2a fall into that category, as you‚Äôll see below.</p>
<p>That is all to say, it‚Äôs important to look at model predicted outcomes, not just the parameters. So let‚Äôs plot the predictions implied by the fits for the models. The general strategy for that is to use the parameter estimates in the posterior, put them in the model, and compute the predictions. We are essentially going through the same steps we did to generate the data. Only now we start with the estimated values. While this could all be manually coded, we happily don‚Äôt need to do so. The <code>rethinking</code> package has some helper functions for that (<code>sim</code> and <code>link</code>).</p>
<p>The code below produces predictions, both for the deterministic mean trajectory <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, and the actual outcome, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, which has added variation due to <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>

<p>Despite differences in estimates for the dose related parameters, the predicted outcomes of the models are very similar. In fact, it‚Äôs hard to tell any difference by just looking at the plots (but they are slightly different, I checked).

<p>So overall, the figures make sense It seems that if we want to do prediction, all models that include individual variability are fine, models 2/2a are not great. If we wanted to estimate the model parameters, specifically <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>, models 1 and 3 and of course 5 don‚Äôt work.
