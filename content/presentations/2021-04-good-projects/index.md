These are slides for a talk/discussion I led with our graduate students discussing how to come up and organize projects in a good way. The talk covered both projects in general and academic projects in particular. <a href="/presentations/2021_04_finding_good_research_topics.html" target="_blank">The presentation slides are here.</a>
